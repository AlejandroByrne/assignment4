You're encountering the CAST5 has been deprecated error because Scapy uses the cryptography library under the hood for certain operations like decryption or handling certain encrypted protocols, and a recent version of cryptography deprecated the CAST5 cipher.

But here‚Äôs the key thing:

You're not even using encryption in your script. The CAST5 warning/error likely stems from Scapy importing all crypto ciphers by default, not from your usage.
‚úÖ Fix Options
ü•á Option 1: Ignore the Warning

If it‚Äôs just a warning, and your graph still generates correctly:

It‚Äôs safe to ignore for now.
You can suppress it by running Python with warnings off:
python3 -W ignore your_script.py
üõ†Ô∏è Option 2: Downgrade cryptography

If it‚Äôs a hard error (breaking the script), downgrade the cryptography package to a version that still supports CAST5:

pip install "cryptography<42.0.0"
That should resolve the CAST5 issue while maintaining compatibility with Scapy.

üßº Option 3: Update Scapy (if it‚Äôs been patched)

Scapy may have patched this already:

pip install --upgrade scapy
