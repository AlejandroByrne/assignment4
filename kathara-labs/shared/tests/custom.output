You're encountering the CAST5 has been deprecated error because Scapy uses the cryptography library under the hood for certain operations like decryption or handling certain encrypted protocols, and a recent version of cryptography deprecated the CAST5 cipher.

But here‚Äôs the key thing:

You're not even using encryption in your script. The CAST5 warning/error likely stems from Scapy importing all crypto ciphers by default, not from your usage.
‚úÖ Fix Options
ü•á Option 1: Ignore the Warning

If it‚Äôs just a warning, and your graph still generates correctly:

It‚Äôs safe to ignore for now.
You can suppress it by running Python with warnings off:
python3 -W ignore your_script.py
üõ†Ô∏è Option 2: Downgrade cryptography

If it‚Äôs a hard error (breaking the script), downgrade the cryptography package to a version that still supports CAST5:

pip install "cryptography<42.0.0"
That should resolve the CAST5 issue while maintaining compatibility with Scapy.

üßº Option 3: Update Scapy (if it‚Äôs been patched)

Scapy may have patched this already:

pip install --upgrade scapy

No matter who you are, where you're from, what your background
is, what you've done and haven't done, what status or wealth you do
or don't have, Martian or not, you can find total peace, unconditional
love, complete fulfillment, and an abundance of joy in your life. I
promise that you are not the exception, even though it may seem like
it. Love knows no boundaries. An open mind and a willing heart are
all you need to receive every answer you've been looking for.
And yes, there are extremely practical implications and
byproducts of understanding what is inside of this book, which many
of my coaching clients have experienced, such as: a 2-5x increase in
income, exponential growth in their businesses, deeper and more
harmonious relationships, overcoming lifelong addictions, the
spontaneous disappearance of destructive habits, an increase in
health, vitality, and overall energy. Miracles like these occur every
day for many who understand the principles within this book. And
this is just the tip of the iceberg. If I were to just list some of the
improvements and results people have gotten from this
understanding, more than half of this book would just be stories of
such miracles that happen daily.
I am reluctant to mention any of these "external" results because
it is not the point of this book. These physical manifestations are the
byproduct of this inside-out understanding of how our experiences of
life work. In actuality, we only want these external results like money
and significance because we want to experience certain feelings
inside such as love, joy, peace, and fulfillment. The feeling is really
what we want in our lives, not the physical things, but the trap is that
we believe the physical things will give us those feelings. The secret
lies within the feeling.
This book will help guide you to understand how to uncover the
truth you already know inside and discover these feelings you've
been looking for your entire life.
Now let's get into the guide of how to go through this book.
Don‚Äôt read this book for information, read it for insight. Insight (or
wisdom) can only be found within. That is why it is called insight (in-
side). To find everything you're looking for in life, you must look
inside yourself and discover the wisdom that already exists within
you. All the answers lie deep within your soul. This book is merely a
guide to help you look in the right place. I truly admire anyone who
still has the hope that what they're looking for is still out there. This
means you have hope. Without hope, we have nothing, so the fact
that you're here, reading this now, is a testament to your faith,
courage, and strength. I know with one hundred percent certainty
that you will find what you're looking for if you continue down the
path you're on with the hope you have in your heart.
I want to make it clear that this book is not the only book that
contains truth. The truth lies within everyone and in everything. You
must look beyond the form (the physical) to see and experience the
truth (the spiritual). The words in this book are not truth. They point
TO the truth. Look beyond words to see the truth for yourself. Truth
cannot be intellectualized; it can only be experienced. The truth lies
within a feeling, which is why it cannot be formulated into a word.
If you want to find truth, look beyond the words, and look for a
feeling.
Many who discover the truth will describe the feeling as one of
complete peace, unconditional love, and an overwhelming amount of
joy. People also describe it as the most familiar unfamiliar feeling. It
feels like you're finally home. Look for that feeling, and everything
will be revealed to you. In this book, I will not say anything that you
don't already know deep inside your soul. This is why it will be a
familiar unfamiliar feeling when you experience the truth.
Don‚Äôt try to use your intellect to figure it out ‚Äî you won‚Äôt. As soon
as you intellectualize it, you've missed it. The truth does not come
from memorizing a sentence or two. A child can do that, but they will
not understand the truth. The truth comes in the form of a feeling.
From that feeling will come the wisdom and truth you‚Äôre looking for,
which will set you free. That's what we're all ultimately seeking, isn't
it?
What I will unveil to you in this book will seem simple. It will seem
almost too simple, and your brain (ego) will try to fight it or attempt to
make it more complex. It will think that it can‚Äôt be this simple. When
that time comes, I want you to remember that the truth is always
simple. What is complex can always be broken down into its smaller
counterparts. The truth cannot be broken down into smaller
constituents, which is what makes it truth. This is why truth is always
simple. If you want to find the truth, look for simplicity.
Approach this book with an open mind and a heart of pure
intention to know the truth and you'll receive everything you've been
searching for.
Before we move on, I want to take a moment to express my
deepest gratitude for you being here and sharing your time and
attention with me. Those are some of the most valuable life forces
you could give to another, so thank you for that gift to me, which you
are also giving to yourself. Never forget your own divinity because it
is only through our divinity that we have our humanity.
With Love & Light,
Joseph
CHAPTER 1
THE JOURNEY TO FINDING THE ROOT CAUSE
OF SUFFERING
"People have a hard time letting go of their suffering. Out of a fear of
the unknown, they prefer suffering that is familiar.‚Äù ‚Äï Thich Nhat
Hanh
There is an important distinction to make when speaking about
suffering. When I mention suffering in this book, I'm referring to
psychological and emotional suffering. There is a way in which, no
matter what happens in your life, you do not have to suffer
emotionally and psychologically.
I am not saying that what we go through is all in our heads or
made up. Terrible and unfortunate events happen to people every
single day. What I'm saying is that although we experience a lot of
pain in our lives, suffering is optional. In other words, pain is
unavoidable, but how we react to the events and circumstances that
happen in our lives is up to us, and that will dictate whether we suffer
or not.
Buddhists say that anytime we experience a negative event in our
lives, two arrows fly our way. Being physically struck by an arrow is
painful. Being struck by a second emotional arrow is even more
painful (suffering).
The Buddha explained, ‚ÄúIn life, we can‚Äôt always control the first
arrow. However, the second arrow is our reaction to the first. The
second arrow is optional.‚Äù
When I first heard of this quote from Buddha a few years back, I
was confounded because although I understood what he meant, I
didn't know how I could apply this in my own life. If anyone were
given the clear choice of suffering and not suffering, I don't think
anyone in their right mind would choose to suffer.
How can I just choose not to suffer? If it were as easy as that I
don't think anyone would be suffering anymore. It wasn't until years
later that I came across a new understanding of where suffering
comes from that I was able to stop it at its source.
As I began my journey of self-improvement, I came across a
myriad of different teachings, studies, and methods to help people
overcome their problems. I read dozens, if not hundreds of books,
studied psychology, went to therapists, listened to many different
thought leaders, tried changing my habits, waking up at 4am,
changing my diet, becoming more structured and disciplined,
shadow work, studying personality types, meditating daily, going on
spiritual retreats, following spiritual masters, and researching
different ancient religions.
If you name it, I've probably tried it. I was desperate to find an
answer because I wanted to know how to stop suffering in my own
life as well as help others do the same. Although some of these
things did help me improve incrementally, it didn‚Äôt stop my suffering. I
still always felt extremely anxious, fearful, unfulfilled, irritated, angry,
frustrated, and heavy every day. Even after doing all of that, I still
didn't discover the answer and, if I'm being honest, I was even more
lost than before I started on this quest.
I felt purposeless, hopeless, and directionless. I didn't know what
to do anymore, where to look, or who to talk to. It wasn't until I was in
my darkest hour that a glimmer of hope began to lead me to the
light.
All of the sudden, after years and years of searching, I stumbled
upon one of my first mentors that taught me how to become a coach
and he revealed to me the answer of how I can alleviate my own
suffering.
The answer I discovered was in the understanding of how our
minds work and how the human experience is created.
CHAPTER 2
THE ROOT CAUSE OF ALL SUFFERING
‚ÄúOne who looks around him is intelligent, one who looks within him is
wise.‚Äù ‚Äï Matshona Dhliwayo
We live in a world of thought, not reality. Sydney Banks once said,
‚ÄúThought is not reality; yet it is through thought that our realities are
created.‚Äù Each of us lives through our own perceptions of the world,
which are vastly different from the person right next to us. An
example of this is that you could be sitting in a coffee shop having a
quarter-life existential crisis, completely stressed out of your mind
about how you have no idea what you‚Äôre doing with your life when it
seems like everyone else has theirs together, while the person next
to you is happily enjoying their freshly brewed drink while peacefully
people watching. You both are in the same exact coffee shop,
smelling the same aroma, surrounded by the same strangers, but
how the world looks to both of you couldn't be more different. Many
of us go through the exact same events or are in the same location
at the same time yet are having completely different experiences of
the world.
Here's another example of how we live in a world of thought and
not reality. If you walk up to 100 different people and ask each of
them what money means to them, how many different answers do
you think you'll get? Close to 100 different answers!
Money is technically the same thing, but it means something
different to each person. Money could mean time, freedom,
opportunity, security, peace of mind, or it could mean evil, greed, and
the reason why people commit crimes. For now, I'm not going to get
into which one is right or wrong (hint: there is no right or wrong
answer, but that's for a different chapter).
Another illustration of this concept is as follows: If you survey 100
different people and ask each of them what they think of our current
president, how many different answers do you think you'll get?
Even though it is the same exact person we're talking about, we
will get 100 different answers because most people live in their own
thoughts and perceptions of the world. The meaning (or thinking) we
give an event is what determines how we ultimately feel about it.
That meaning or thinking is the filter through which we see life from
then on ‚Äî because of this, we live through a perception of reality,
not in reality itself. Reality is that the event happened, with no
meaning, thinking, or interpretation of it.
Any meaning or thinking we give the event is on us and that is
how our perception of reality is created. This is how our experience
of life is created from the inside out.
It's not about the events that happen in our lives, but our
interpretation of them, which causes us to feel good or bad about
something. This is how people in third world countries can be
happier than people in first world countries and people in first world
countries can be more miserable than people in third world
countries.
Our feelings do not come from external events, but from our
own thinking about the events. Therefore, we can only ever feel
what we are thinking.
Let's hypothetically say that you really hate your job, and it causes
you an enormous amount of stress, anxiety, and frustration. It pains
you to even set foot in the building where you work and just thinking
about your job makes you furious. When you're thinking about your
job, you're just sitting there on a sofa with your family watching a TV
show together, but you are fuming at the thought of your job.
Everyone else is having a good time, except you.
In this moment, everyone else in your family is having a different
experience of life than you, even though the same event is
happening. Just the thought of work created a whole different
perception of reality, even though you're not physically at work.
If it were true that external events cause us to feel the way we feel
inside, then you should be a happy camper in your living room,
watching a funny TV show with your family every single time you do
this activity ‚Äî but that's not the case.
Now, you may be saying that you're only feeling this way because
an external event, your job, is causing you to feel stressed and
anxious. To that I'll ask the question, is it absolutely true that every
single person feels the exact same way about the job they're working
in?
Two different people can be doing the exact same job but will
have completely different experiences of that job. It can be the most
amazing experience and a dream job for one person but be another
person's worst nightmare and living hell. The only difference
between one person and the other is how they think about their job,
which determines how they ultimately feel about it.
Now let's go back to the original scenario of you hypothetically
hating your job. Remember how much stress, anxiety, and frustration
it causes you when you think about it?
Let's do a quick thought experiment about that by answering the
question below:
Who would you be without that thought that you hated your
job?
Take 1 minute to see what comes up for you and don't move on
until you do that.
If you don't overthink it and truly let the answers surface from
within you, without that thought, you will most likely feel and be
happy, peaceful, free, and light.
Without our usual thinking about a particular event or thing, our
experience of it completely alters. This is how we live in a world of
thought, not reality, and how our perception of reality is created from
the inside out, through our own thinking. With this new
understanding, you've just uncovered the cause of all our human
psychological suffering...
The root cause of our suffering is our own thinking.
Now before you throw this book across the room and light it on
fire, I'm not saying that this is all in our heads and that it isn't real.
Our perception of reality is very real. We will feel what we think, and
our feelings are real. That is completely undeniable. However, our
thinking will look like an inevitable, unchangeable reality to us until
we begin seeing how our reality is created. If we know that we can
only ever feel what we are thinking, then we know that we can
change our feelings by changing our thinking. Thus, we can change
our experience of life by knowing that it comes from our own
thinking. And if that is true, then we are ever only one thought away
from experiencing something different and transforming our entire
lives at any moment ‚Äî through a state of no thought.
In short, the moment we stop thinking is when our happiness
begins.
A Young Monk & the Empty Boat (A Zen Story About How
Thinking is the Cause of Our Own Suffering)
A long time ago, a young Zen monk was living in a small
monastery that was located in a forest which was near a small lake.
The monastery was occupied by a few senior monks while the rest
were newcomers and still had much to learn. The monks had many
obligations in the monastery, but one of the most important ones was
their daily routine where they had to sit down, close their eyes, and
meditate in silence for hours at a time.
After each meditation, they had to report their progress to their
mentor. The young monk had difficulty staying focused during his
meditation practice for a variety of reasons, which made him very
mad. After the young monk reported his progress, or better said, lack
of it, to his mentor, the elder monk asked the young monk a simple
question that had a hidden lesson, ‚ÄúDo you know what is really
making you angry?‚Äù The young monk replied, ‚ÄúWell, usually as soon
as I close my eyes and begin to meditate, there is someone moving
around, and I can‚Äôt focus. I get agitated that someone is disturbing
me even though they know that I‚Äôm meditating. How can they not be
more considerate? And then when I close my eyes again and try to
focus, a cat or a small animal might brush past and disturb me again.
By this point, even when the wind blows and the tree branches make
noise, I get angry. If that is not enough, the birds keep on chirping,
and I can‚Äôt seem to find any peace in this place.‚Äù
The elder monk simply pointed out to his pupil, ‚ÄúI see that you
become angrier with each interruption you encounter. This is exactly
the opposite of what is the point of your task when meditating. You
should find a way not to get angry with people, or animals, or any
other thing around you that disturbs you during your task.‚Äù After their
consultation, the young monk went out of the monastery and looked
around to find a place that would be quieter so that he could
meditate peacefully. He found such a place at the shore of the lake
that is nearby. He brought his mat, sat down, and started meditating.
But soon a flock of birds splashed down in the lake near where the
monk was meditating. Hearing their noise, the monk opened his
eyes to see what was going on.
Although the bank of the lake was quieter than the monastery,
there were still things that would disturb his peace and he again got
angry. Even though he didn‚Äôt find the peace he was looking for, he
kept returning to the lake. Then one day, the monk saw a boat tied at
the end of a small pier. And right then an idea hit him, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt I
take the boat, row it down to the middle of the lake and meditate
there? In the middle of the lake, there will be nothing to disturb me!‚Äù
He rowed the boat to the middle of the lake and started meditating.
As he had expected, there was nothing in the middle of the lake to
disturb him and he was able to meditate the whole day. At the end of
the day, he returned to the monastery. This continued for a couple of
days and the monk was thrilled that he had finally found a place to
meditate in peace. He hadn‚Äôt felt angry and could continue the
meditation practice in a calm manner.
On the third day, the monk sat in the boat, rowed to the middle of
the lake, and started meditating again. A few minutes later, he heard
some splashing of water and felt that the boat was rocking. He
started getting upset that even in the middle of the lake there was
someone or something disturbing him.
When he opened his eyes, he saw a boat heading straight
towards him. He shouted, ‚ÄúSteer your boat away, or else you will hit
my boat.‚Äù But the other boat kept coming straight at him and was just
a few feet away. He yelled again but nothing changed and so the
incoming boat hit the monk‚Äôs boat. Now he was furious. He
screamed, ‚ÄúWho are you, and why have you hit my boat in the
middle of this vast lake?‚Äù There was no answer. This made the
young monk even angrier.
He stood up to see who was in the other boat and to his surprise,
he found that there was no one in the boat.
The boat had probably drifted along in the breeze and had
bumped into the monk‚Äôs boat. The monk found his anger dissipating.
It was just an empty boat! There was no one to get angry at!
At that moment he remembered his mentors‚Äô question, ‚ÄúDo you
know what is really making you angry?‚Äù And then wondered, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not
other people, situations, or circumstances. It‚Äôs not the empty boat,
but my reaction to it that causes my anger. All the people or
situations that make me upset and angry are just like the empty boat.
They don‚Äôt have the power to make me angry without my own
reaction.‚Äù
The monk then rowed the boat back to the shore. He returned to
the monastery and started meditating along with the other monks.
There were still noises and disturbances around, but the monk
treated them as the ‚Äúempty boat‚Äù and continued to meditate
peacefully. When the elder monk saw the difference, he simply said
to the young monk, ‚ÄúI see that you have found what is really making
you angry and overcome that.‚Äù
CHAPTER 3
WHY DO WE EVEN THINK?
‚ÄúI think and think and think, I've thought myself out of happiness one
million times, but never once into it.‚Äù ‚Äî Jonathan Safran Foer
We as humans have evolved to develop a sophisticated ability to
rationalize, analyze, and think because it simply helped us survive.
Our minds do an incredible job to keep us alive, but it does not help
us thrive. It is concerned solely with our safety and survival, but not
our fulfillment or joy.
The mind‚Äôs job is to alert us of potential dangers in our
environment that may threaten our lives. It does its job so well that
not only will it scan our immediate surroundings for threats, but it will
even reference our backlog of past experiences to create
hypothetical scenarios and predict what it thinks could be future
potential dangers based on our memories.
None of this is wrong by any means. The mind is simply doing
what it was designed to do. When we don‚Äôt understand that its only
duty is to help us survive, then we will get angry and frustrated with
it. All conflict is derived from an innocent misunderstanding. Our
mind‚Äôs duty is to keep us alive. Our consciousness‚Äôs duty is to help
us feel fulfilled. Your soul is the reason why you‚Äôre even on this
journey in the first place ‚Äî to find peace, love, and joy for yourself.
Your mind has done an amazing job at what it was made to do,
but now you may relieve it of its job because we no longer live in the
wild where death could be right around the corner in a bush. If we
keep using our minds, we will constantly stay in a state of fight or
flight, anxiety, fear, frustration, depression, anger, resentment, and
all negative emotions because the mind thinks everything is a threat
to our very existence. If you want to be free, happy, peaceful, and full
of love, then you will need to let go of listening only to your mind and
go beyond it by tuning into something much greater that will help you
not just to survive, but to thrive.
CHAPTER 4
THOUGHTS VS. THINKING
‚ÄúStop thinking and end your problems.‚Äù ‚Äï Lao Tzu
Thoughts are the energetic, mental raw materials from which we use
to create everything in the world. We can‚Äôt experience anything
without thought. It‚Äôs important to know that thoughts are a noun and
aren‚Äôt something that we do, but something we have. A thought
takes no effort or force on our end, and it is something that just
happens. We also cannot control what thoughts pop into our minds.
The source of thoughts comes from something that is beyond our
minds ‚Äî the Universe, if you will.
Thinking, on the other hand, is the act of thinking about our
thoughts. This takes a significant amount of energy, effort, and
willpower (which is a finite resource). Thinking is actively engaging
with the thoughts in your mind. You don‚Äôt have to engage with each
thought in your mind, but when you do, that is thinking.
Thinking is the root cause of all our psychological suffering.
Now you might be wondering, where do positive thoughts fit into
the picture? Positive thoughts, or thoughts that feel good, are not a
result of thinking. They are, instead, generated by our natural state
of peace, love, and joy. They are a byproduct of a state of being, not
a state of thinking. We will go into depth about this in the next
chapter.
For now, let‚Äôs do a quick thought experiment.
I‚Äôll ask you a question and all you need to do is to be aware of
what you‚Äôre experiencing, and we‚Äôll review what happened after.
What is the dream amount of money you want to be making a
year?
Pause here and wait for an answer to surface.
Give yourself about 30-60 seconds to think about your answer of
how much money you want to be making in a year.
Don‚Äôt move on to the next step until you‚Äôve had a decently sized
train of thought about how much you want to make.
Now take that amount and multiply that by 5.
What do you think about this new dream goal for your income
when we multiplied it by 5?
Take at least another 30-60 seconds to become aware of how
you‚Äôre feeling when you think about that and see what other thinking
comes up for you as you feel your emotions.
Don‚Äôt move on until you‚Äôve done the above.
Okay, let‚Äôs bring it back in and review what happened.
After I asked the first question of what is the dream amount of
money you want to be making per year, within a few seconds an
answer popped up in your mind. That is a thought. Notice how
quickly and effortlessly that came to you.
After an answer popped into your mind, I asked you to think about
your answer. What happened once I asked you to think about your
answer?
If you‚Äôre like most people, you probably went on a wild
rollercoaster once you began thinking about the thought.
You might have been thinking how there‚Äôs no way you can make
that much, no one in your family is making that much money, you
don‚Äôt know how to make that much, it‚Äôs stupid to want that much
money or that it makes you greedy.
Notice how you felt when you were thinking about those thoughts.
Most likely it didn‚Äôt feel that great, but that is okay, and I‚Äôll show
you what you can do about it soon.
This is a prime example of thoughts versus thinking.
If I ask you a question, you will 100% have a thought that pops
into your mind.
Thoughts are not inherently bad. Remember that they are the
energetic mental raw materials from which we create in the world.
The moment we think about our thoughts is when we begin to get
taken on an emotional rollercoaster. When we think about our
thoughts, we begin to judge and criticize the thoughts and
experience all sorts of internal emotional turmoil.
When I asked you how much you wanted to make, you had a
thought about the amount. That thought was neutral and didn‚Äôt cause
any emotional toil. In fact, you might have felt expansive and excited.
It was only when you began thinking about that thought of how much
you wanted to make which is what caused the self-doubt,
unworthiness, anxiety, anger, guilt, or any other emotion you may
have experienced.
This is what I mean by thinking is the root of all of our suffering.
Having the initial thought of how much you wanted to make didn‚Äôt
cause any suffering until you began thinking about the thought of
how much you wanted to make.
It is not necessary to think about our thoughts or to judge them. It
does us no good to do so. We may think that thinking is helping us,
but all it‚Äôs really doing is causing us to feel all of these negative,
unwanted emotions and making us create reasons as to why we
can‚Äôt do it or why we shouldn‚Äôt want it.
The only thing that was useful and helpful was the initial thought
that popped into your mind when I first asked how much you wanted
to make. All of the thinking that happened after was destructive and
unhelpful.
Thoughts create. Thinking destroys.
The reason thinking destroys is because as soon as we begin to
think about the thoughts, we cast our own limiting beliefs,
judgements, criticisms, programming, and conditioning onto the
thought, thinking of infinite reasons as to why we can‚Äôt do it and why
we can‚Äôt have it.
Without thinking, we prevent all negative programming and
judgements from tarnishing the initial thought of what you want to
create.
If I asked you what are some ways you could make the amount of
money you want, if you sat there long enough, you‚Äôll experience the
same phenomenon of having random thoughts pop into your head of
ways you could make it happen.
These are thoughts of creation. Thoughts are inherently infinite,
expansive, and energetically positive. You‚Äôll know you are having
thoughts from the divine when you feel positive emotions, feel lighter,
and alive.
As soon as you begin thinking about those thoughts of the ways
you can make the money you want, you‚Äôll immediately feel heavy,
restricted, limited, along with a whole onslaught of negative
emotions. This is how you‚Äôll know if you‚Äôre thinking.
I use my feelings as an internal radar that tells me whether I‚Äôm
getting direct downloads of thoughts from the Universe or if I‚Äôm in my
head thinking about my thoughts.
You can only ever feel what you‚Äôre thinking, so feelings and
emotions are like an intuitive internal dashboard which tells me if I‚Äôm
thinking too much or not.
If I‚Äôm having a lot of negative emotions, I know that I‚Äôm thinking
too much. This is another example of how we‚Äôre naturally built for
success.
Below is a chart that compares Thinking vs. Thoughts to help you
identify which one is which within your mind:

CHAPTER 5
IF WE CAN ONLY FEEL WHAT WE'RE THINKING,
DON'T WE NEED TO THINK POSITIVELY TO FEEL
THAT WAY?
‚ÄúWe are ever only one thought away from peace, love, and joy ‚Äî
which come from a state of no thought.‚Äù ‚Äî Dicken Bettinger
There is a caveat that I haven't mentioned yet to the principle that we
can only feel what we're thinking. The more accurate way of
describing it is that we can only ever feel negative emotions when
we are thinking.
The goal isn't necessarily to completely stop feeling negative
emotions. Some of the negative emotions can be helpful, such as
feeling fearful when deciding to walk down a dark alley alone with no
one else in sight.
These negative emotions are only helpful to us in terms of
survival, but if we don't constantly encounter life or death situations,
negative emotions are more unhelpful than helpful for most of us.
We're going to be moving forward with the context that we're not
struggling for physical survival, so we'll be using the context that
negative emotions are not necessary most of the time.
When I mention that we can only ever feel what we're thinking,
most people assume that we must think positive to feel positive
emotions.
Instead of convincing you if this is true or not, let's do another
thought experiment so you can experience the truth for yourself.
Recall a time when you felt the most joy and love you've ever felt
in your life and feel the feelings that you felt at that time as much as
you can for at least 30 seconds.
What kinds of thoughts were going through your mind at that peak
moment when you felt the most joy and love? (I'm not asking what
you were doing at the time, but what thoughts were going through
your head at that exact moment.)
For many people that answer this, they realize that they didn't
have any thoughts during that exact moment. For others, they say
that the thought was that they were so grateful or happy.
For those that answered that they had the thought that they were
grateful, did you feel that joy and love before you had that thought or
after?
Take 10-15 seconds to answer that question before moving on.
What insights and epiphanies did you have?
What's crazy is that most people didn't have any thoughts going
through their mind when they felt the happiest and the most amount
of love in their lives. For those that had the thought that they were
grateful, they felt that way before having that thought.
If they had that thought, it happened after they felt the feelings, so
the thought could not have produced the feeling.
This brings us to another truth: you do not have to have
thoughts or think to feel positive emotions.
The beautiful part about truth is that it needs no justification
because it can be experienced right here right now. It doesn't need
to be proven or rationalized to you and you experienced this truth
firsthand by the experiment we just did.
Here's why we don't need to have thoughts or think to feel positive
emotions like joy and love.
Our natural state of being IS joy, love, ecstasy, freedom, and
gratitude. This may be hard to believe because if it's natural, why
don't we feel that way all the time? I'll answer this in a bit.
If we want to see the natural state of anything, one of the best
ways is to look at nature and the state of it in its infancy (before it is
affected and conditioned by its environment).
For example, let's look at the natural state of a baby. What is a
baby's natural and default state (assuming the baby wasn't abused,
neglected, or had any physical issues)? Are babies naturally
stressed, anxious, fearful, and self-conscious? Or are they naturally
in a state of bliss, happiness, and love?
Our natural state of being is joy, love, and peace. Therefore, any
thinking that we do will only take us away from those natural states
of being, which is why whenever we feel extremely stressed, we are
having a LOT of thinking going on. The strength of the negative
emotion we feel is in direct proportion to how much thinking we are
doing in the moment.
On the other hand, the intensity of the positive emotion we feel is
inversely proportional to the amount of thinking we are doing in the
moment. In other words, the less thinking we have going on, the
stronger the positive emotion we feel in the present.
To see the truth in this, recall a few other memories you had when
you were extremely stressed and anxious and see how much
thinking was going on at the time.
Take about 1-2 minutes to do this.
Then recall a few memories where you were at your happiest or
felt the most joy and love and see how much thinking you had going
on at that time.
Take another 1-2 minutes to do this before moving on to really
experience and internalize the truth of what you see.
An analogy that my coach taught me that helped crystallize this
concept was to imagine our mind has a speedometer (like in a car),
but instead of miles per hour, it is thoughts per minute. The more
thinking we have going on, the higher the ‚Äúthought-o-meter‚Äù goes,
and if we have enough thinking going on, it'll go into the red zone.
This is when we feel extremely stressed, burned out, frustrated, and
angry.
It is not the content of our thinking that causes us stress, but that
we are thinking, period. The amount of thinking we have going on is
directly correlated to the magnitude of stress and negative emotions
we are experiencing at any given moment. When you're
experiencing a lot of frustration, stress, anxiety, or any negative
emotions, just know that it is because you're thinking, and the
intensity of those emotions is directly correlated to how much
thinking is going on.
Therefore, it's not WHAT we're thinking about that is causing
us suffering, but THAT we are thinking.
To summarize, we do not have to try to "think positive" to
experience love, joy, bliss, and any positive emotions we want
because it is our natural state to feel those emotions. The only times
we don't naturally feel these emotions is when we begin to think
about the thoughts we're having, thus blocking the direct connection
to Infinite Intelligence and we feel stressed, anxious, depressed, and
fearful. It is not about the content of our thinking, but that we're
thinking, which is the root cause of our suffering. The intensity of the
negative emotions is directly correlated to the amount of thinking we
have going on in the present. The less thinking we have, the more
space we create for positive emotions to naturally surface.
CHAPTER 6
HOW THE HUMAN EXPERIENCE IS CREATED -
THE THREE PRINCIPLES
‚ÄúIf the only thing people learned was not to be afraid of their
experience, that alone would change the world.‚Äù ‚Äî Sydney Banks
At its fundamental level, the human experience is created by these
three principles: Universal Mind, Consciousness, and Thought.
These three principles work together to allow us to experience
everything we do in life and if one of the three is missing, we
wouldn't be able to experience anything. These principles were first
discovered by Sydney Banks and now I have the humbling privilege
to share them with you.
Understanding these three principles enables us to know how we
can alleviate ourselves from our suffering, but also allows us to
create from Source.
Universal Mind
Universal Mind is the Intelligence behind all living things. It is the
life force and energy that is in all things. It is how an acorn knows
how to grow into a tree, how the planets know how to stay in orbit,
and how our bodies know how to heal itself when we get a cut. It's
how our bodies know how to self-regulate and keep us alive without
us having to manually do everything like breathing and beating our
heart. The Intelligence that knows how to do all of this and is in all
things is called the Universal Mind. Many people call this God,
Infinite Intelligence, the Quantum Field, Source, and other names.
This is where Thoughts come from as well as everything else in the
Universe. All things are connected by Universal Mind. There is no
separation between anything, and any time there seems to be
separation between things, it is merely an illusion of our thinking.
When we are connected to Universal Mind, we feel whole, fulfilled,
filled with love, joy, peace, and inspiration. It is only when we begin
thinking (believing the illusion or ego) that we block this flow of
Universal Mind and begin to feel separated, frustrated, lonely, angry,
resentful, sad, depressed, and fearful.
Universal Consciousness
Universal Consciousness is the collective consciousness of all
things. It is what allows us to be aware that we exist and aware of
our thoughts. Without Universal Consciousness, we wouldn't be able
to experience anything. Our five senses would have no use because
there's nothing to be aware of. This is what brings things to life and
makes them perceivable to us.
Universal Thought
‚ÄúWe cannot change what we are not aware of, and once we are
aware, we cannot help but change.‚Äù - Sheryl Sanberg
No matter who you are, where you're from, what your background
is, what you've done and haven't done, what status or wealth you do
or don't have, Martian or not, you can find total peace, unconditional
love, complete fulfillment, and an abundance of joy in your life. I
promise that you are not the exception, even though it may seem like
it. Love knows no boundaries. An open mind and a willing heart are
all you need to receive every answer you've been looking for.
And yes, there are extremely practical implications and
byproducts of understanding what is inside of this book, which many
of my coaching clients have experienced, such as: a 2-5x increase in
income, exponential growth in their businesses, deeper and more
harmonious relationships, overcoming lifelong addictions, the
spontaneous disappearance of destructive habits, an increase in
health, vitality, and overall energy. Miracles like these occur every
day for many who understand the principles within this book. And
this is just the tip of the iceberg. If I were to just list some of the
improvements and results people have gotten from this
understanding, more than half of this book would just be stories of
such miracles that happen daily.
I am reluctant to mention any of these "external" results because
it is not the point of this book. These physical manifestations are the
byproduct of this inside-out understanding of how our experiences of
life work. In actuality, we only want these external results like money
and significance because we want to experience certain feelings
inside such as love, joy, peace, and fulfillment. The feeling is really
what we want in our lives, not the physical things, but the trap is that
we believe the physical things will give us those feelings. The secret
lies within the feeling.
This book will help guide you to understand how to uncover the
truth you already know inside and discover these feelings you've
been looking for your entire life.
Now let's get into the guide of how to go through this book.
Don‚Äôt read this book for information, read it for insight. Insight (or
wisdom) can only be found within. That is why it is called insight (in-
side). To find everything you're looking for in life, you must look
inside yourself and discover the wisdom that already exists within
you. All the answers lie deep within your soul. This book is merely a
guide to help you look in the right place. I truly admire anyone who
still has the hope that what they're looking for is still out there. This
means you have hope. Without hope, we have nothing, so the fact
that you're here, reading this now, is a testament to your faith,
courage, and strength. I know with one hundred percent certainty
that you will find what you're looking for if you continue down the
path you're on with the hope you have in your heart.
I want to make it clear that this book is not the only book that
contains truth. The truth lies within everyone and in everything. You
must look beyond the form (the physical) to see and experience the
truth (the spiritual). The words in this book are not truth. They point
TO the truth. Look beyond words to see the truth for yourself. Truth
cannot be intellectualized; it can only be experienced. The truth lies
within a feeling, which is why it cannot be formulated into a word.
If you want to find truth, look beyond the words, and look for a
feeling.
Many who discover the truth will describe the feeling as one of
complete peace, unconditional love, and an overwhelming amount of
joy. People also describe it as the most familiar unfamiliar feeling. It
feels like you're finally home. Look for that feeling, and everything
will be revealed to you. In this book, I will not say anything that you
don't already know deep inside your soul. This is why it will be a
familiar unfamiliar feeling when you experience the truth.
Don‚Äôt try to use your intellect to figure it out ‚Äî you won‚Äôt. As soon
as you intellectualize it, you've missed it. The truth does not come
from memorizing a sentence or two. A child can do that, but they will
not understand the truth. The truth comes in the form of a feeling.
From that feeling will come the wisdom and truth you‚Äôre looking for,
which will set you free. That's what we're all ultimately seeking, isn't
it?
What I will unveil to you in this book will seem simple. It will seem
almost too simple, and your brain (ego) will try to fight it or attempt to
make it more complex. It will think that it can‚Äôt be this simple. When
that time comes, I want you to remember that the truth is always
simple. What is complex can always be broken down into its smaller
counterparts. The truth cannot be broken down into smaller
constituents, which is what makes it truth. This is why truth is always
simple. If you want to find the truth, look for simplicity.
Approach this book with an open mind and a heart of pure
intention to know the truth and you'll receive everything you've been
searching for.
Before we move on, I want to take a moment to express my
deepest gratitude for you being here and sharing your time and
attention with me. Those are some of the most valuable life forces
you could give to another, so thank you for that gift to me, which you
are also giving to yourself. Never forget your own divinity because it
is only through our divinity that we have our humanity.
With Love & Light,
Joseph
CHAPTER 1
THE JOURNEY TO FINDING THE ROOT CAUSE
OF SUFFERING
"People have a hard time letting go of their suffering. Out of a fear of
the unknown, they prefer suffering that is familiar.‚Äù ‚Äï Thich Nhat
Hanh
There is an important distinction to make when speaking about
suffering. When I mention suffering in this book, I'm referring to
psychological and emotional suffering. There is a way in which, no
matter what happens in your life, you do not have to suffer
emotionally and psychologically.
I am not saying that what we go through is all in our heads or
made up. Terrible and unfortunate events happen to people every
single day. What I'm saying is that although we experience a lot of
pain in our lives, suffering is optional. In other words, pain is
unavoidable, but how we react to the events and circumstances that
happen in our lives is up to us, and that will dictate whether we suffer
or not.
Buddhists say that anytime we experience a negative event in our
lives, two arrows fly our way. Being physically struck by an arrow is
painful. Being struck by a second emotional arrow is even more
painful (suffering).
The Buddha explained, ‚ÄúIn life, we can‚Äôt always control the first
arrow. However, the second arrow is our reaction to the first. The
second arrow is optional.‚Äù
When I first heard of this quote from Buddha a few years back, I
was confounded because although I understood what he meant, I
didn't know how I could apply this in my own life. If anyone were
given the clear choice of suffering and not suffering, I don't think
anyone in their right mind would choose to suffer.
How can I just choose not to suffer? If it were as easy as that I
don't think anyone would be suffering anymore. It wasn't until years
later that I came across a new understanding of where suffering
comes from that I was able to stop it at its source.
As I began my journey of self-improvement, I came across a
myriad of different teachings, studies, and methods to help people
overcome their problems. I read dozens, if not hundreds of books,
studied psychology, went to therapists, listened to many different
thought leaders, tried changing my habits, waking up at 4am,
changing my diet, becoming more structured and disciplined,
shadow work, studying personality types, meditating daily, going on
spiritual retreats, following spiritual masters, and researching
different ancient religions.
If you name it, I've probably tried it. I was desperate to find an
answer because I wanted to know how to stop suffering in my own
life as well as help others do the same. Although some of these
things did help me improve incrementally, it didn‚Äôt stop my suffering. I
still always felt extremely anxious, fearful, unfulfilled, irritated, angry,
frustrated, and heavy every day. Even after doing all of that, I still
didn't discover the answer and, if I'm being honest, I was even more
lost than before I started on this quest.
I felt purposeless, hopeless, and directionless. I didn't know what
to do anymore, where to look, or who to talk to. It wasn't until I was in
my darkest hour that a glimmer of hope began to lead me to the
light.
All of the sudden, after years and years of searching, I stumbled
upon one of my first mentors that taught me how to become a coach
and he revealed to me the answer of how I can alleviate my own
suffering.
The answer I discovered was in the understanding of how our
minds work and how the human experience is created.
CHAPTER 2
THE ROOT CAUSE OF ALL SUFFERING
‚ÄúOne who looks around him is intelligent, one who looks within him is
wise.‚Äù ‚Äï Matshona Dhliwayo
We live in a world of thought, not reality. Sydney Banks once said,
‚ÄúThought is not reality; yet it is through thought that our realities are
created.‚Äù Each of us lives through our own perceptions of the world,
which are vastly different from the person right next to us. An
example of this is that you could be sitting in a coffee shop having a
quarter-life existential crisis, completely stressed out of your mind
about how you have no idea what you‚Äôre doing with your life when it
seems like everyone else has theirs together, while the person next
to you is happily enjoying their freshly brewed drink while peacefully
people watching. You both are in the same exact coffee shop,
smelling the same aroma, surrounded by the same strangers, but
how the world looks to both of you couldn't be more different. Many
of us go through the exact same events or are in the same location
at the same time yet are having completely different experiences of
the world.
Here's another example of how we live in a world of thought and
not reality. If you walk up to 100 different people and ask each of
them what money means to them, how many different answers do
you think you'll get? Close to 100 different answers!
Money is technically the same thing, but it means something
different to each person. Money could mean time, freedom,
opportunity, security, peace of mind, or it could mean evil, greed, and
the reason why people commit crimes. For now, I'm not going to get
into which one is right or wrong (hint: there is no right or wrong
answer, but that's for a different chapter).
Another illustration of this concept is as follows: If you survey 100
different people and ask each of them what they think of our current
president, how many different answers do you think you'll get?
Even though it is the same exact person we're talking about, we
will get 100 different answers because most people live in their own
thoughts and perceptions of the world. The meaning (or thinking) we
give an event is what determines how we ultimately feel about it.
That meaning or thinking is the filter through which we see life from
then on ‚Äî because of this, we live through a perception of reality,
not in reality itself. Reality is that the event happened, with no
meaning, thinking, or interpretation of it.
Any meaning or thinking we give the event is on us and that is
how our perception of reality is created. This is how our experience
of life is created from the inside out.
It's not about the events that happen in our lives, but our
interpretation of them, which causes us to feel good or bad about
something. This is how people in third world countries can be
happier than people in first world countries and people in first world
countries can be more miserable than people in third world
countries.
Our feelings do not come from external events, but from our
own thinking about the events. Therefore, we can only ever feel
what we are thinking.
Let's hypothetically say that you really hate your job, and it causes
you an enormous amount of stress, anxiety, and frustration. It pains
you to even set foot in the building where you work and just thinking
about your job makes you furious. When you're thinking about your
job, you're just sitting there on a sofa with your family watching a TV
show together, but you are fuming at the thought of your job.
Everyone else is having a good time, except you.
In this moment, everyone else in your family is having a different
experience of life than you, even though the same event is
happening. Just the thought of work created a whole different
perception of reality, even though you're not physically at work.
If it were true that external events cause us to feel the way we feel
inside, then you should be a happy camper in your living room,
watching a funny TV show with your family every single time you do
this activity ‚Äî but that's not the case.
Now, you may be saying that you're only feeling this way because
an external event, your job, is causing you to feel stressed and
anxious. To that I'll ask the question, is it absolutely true that every
single person feels the exact same way about the job they're working
in?
Two different people can be doing the exact same job but will
have completely different experiences of that job. It can be the most
amazing experience and a dream job for one person but be another
person's worst nightmare and living hell. The only difference
between one person and the other is how they think about their job,
which determines how they ultimately feel about it.
Now let's go back to the original scenario of you hypothetically
hating your job. Remember how much stress, anxiety, and frustration
it causes you when you think about it?
Let's do a quick thought experiment about that by answering the
question below:
Who would you be without that thought that you hated your
job?
Take 1 minute to see what comes up for you and don't move on
until you do that.
If you don't overthink it and truly let the answers surface from
within you, without that thought, you will most likely feel and be
happy, peaceful, free, and light.
Without our usual thinking about a particular event or thing, our
experience of it completely alters. This is how we live in a world of
thought, not reality, and how our perception of reality is created from
the inside out, through our own thinking. With this new
understanding, you've just uncovered the cause of all our human
psychological suffering...
The root cause of our suffering is our own thinking.
Now before you throw this book across the room and light it on
fire, I'm not saying that this is all in our heads and that it isn't real.
Our perception of reality is very real. We will feel what we think, and
our feelings are real. That is completely undeniable. However, our
thinking will look like an inevitable, unchangeable reality to us until
we begin seeing how our reality is created. If we know that we can
only ever feel what we are thinking, then we know that we can
change our feelings by changing our thinking. Thus, we can change
our experience of life by knowing that it comes from our own
thinking. And if that is true, then we are ever only one thought away
from experiencing something different and transforming our entire
lives at any moment ‚Äî through a state of no thought.
In short, the moment we stop thinking is when our happiness
begins.
A Young Monk & the Empty Boat (A Zen Story About How
Thinking is the Cause of Our Own Suffering)
A long time ago, a young Zen monk was living in a small
monastery that was located in a forest which was near a small lake.
The monastery was occupied by a few senior monks while the rest
were newcomers and still had much to learn. The monks had many
obligations in the monastery, but one of the most important ones was
their daily routine where they had to sit down, close their eyes, and
meditate in silence for hours at a time.
After each meditation, they had to report their progress to their
mentor. The young monk had difficulty staying focused during his
meditation practice for a variety of reasons, which made him very
mad. After the young monk reported his progress, or better said, lack
of it, to his mentor, the elder monk asked the young monk a simple
question that had a hidden lesson, ‚ÄúDo you know what is really
making you angry?‚Äù The young monk replied, ‚ÄúWell, usually as soon
as I close my eyes and begin to meditate, there is someone moving
around, and I can‚Äôt focus. I get agitated that someone is disturbing
me even though they know that I‚Äôm meditating. How can they not be
more considerate? And then when I close my eyes again and try to
focus, a cat or a small animal might brush past and disturb me again.
By this point, even when the wind blows and the tree branches make
noise, I get angry. If that is not enough, the birds keep on chirping,
and I can‚Äôt seem to find any peace in this place.‚Äù
The elder monk simply pointed out to his pupil, ‚ÄúI see that you
become angrier with each interruption you encounter. This is exactly
the opposite of what is the point of your task when meditating. You
should find a way not to get angry with people, or animals, or any
other thing around you that disturbs you during your task.‚Äù After their
consultation, the young monk went out of the monastery and looked
around to find a place that would be quieter so that he could
meditate peacefully. He found such a place at the shore of the lake
that is nearby. He brought his mat, sat down, and started meditating.
But soon a flock of birds splashed down in the lake near where the
monk was meditating. Hearing their noise, the monk opened his
eyes to see what was going on.
Although the bank of the lake was quieter than the monastery,
there were still things that would disturb his peace and he again got
angry. Even though he didn‚Äôt find the peace he was looking for, he
kept returning to the lake. Then one day, the monk saw a boat tied at
the end of a small pier. And right then an idea hit him, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt I
take the boat, row it down to the middle of the lake and meditate
there? In the middle of the lake, there will be nothing to disturb me!‚Äù
He rowed the boat to the middle of the lake and started meditating.
As he had expected, there was nothing in the middle of the lake to
disturb him and he was able to meditate the whole day. At the end of
the day, he returned to the monastery. This continued for a couple of
days and the monk was thrilled that he had finally found a place to
meditate in peace. He hadn‚Äôt felt angry and could continue the
meditation practice in a calm manner.
On the third day, the monk sat in the boat, rowed to the middle of
the lake, and started meditating again. A few minutes later, he heard
some splashing of water and felt that the boat was rocking. He
started getting upset that even in the middle of the lake there was
someone or something disturbing him.
When he opened his eyes, he saw a boat heading straight
towards him. He shouted, ‚ÄúSteer your boat away, or else you will hit
my boat.‚Äù But the other boat kept coming straight at him and was just
a few feet away. He yelled again but nothing changed and so the
incoming boat hit the monk‚Äôs boat. Now he was furious. He
screamed, ‚ÄúWho are you, and why have you hit my boat in the
middle of this vast lake?‚Äù There was no answer. This made the
young monk even angrier.
He stood up to see who was in the other boat and to his surprise,
he found that there was no one in the boat.
The boat had probably drifted along in the breeze and had
bumped into the monk‚Äôs boat. The monk found his anger dissipating.
It was just an empty boat! There was no one to get angry at!
At that moment he remembered his mentors‚Äô question, ‚ÄúDo you
know what is really making you angry?‚Äù And then wondered, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not
other people, situations, or circumstances. It‚Äôs not the empty boat,
but my reaction to it that causes my anger. All the people or
situations that make me upset and angry are just like the empty boat.
They don‚Äôt have the power to make me angry without my own
reaction.‚Äù
The monk then rowed the boat back to the shore. He returned to
the monastery and started meditating along with the other monks.
There were still noises and disturbances around, but the monk
treated them as the ‚Äúempty boat‚Äù and continued to meditate
peacefully. When the elder monk saw the difference, he simply said
to the young monk, ‚ÄúI see that you have found what is really making
you angry and overcome that.‚Äù
CHAPTER 3
WHY DO WE EVEN THINK?
‚ÄúI think and think and think, I've thought myself out of happiness one
million times, but never once into it.‚Äù ‚Äî Jonathan Safran Foer
We as humans have evolved to develop a sophisticated ability to
rationalize, analyze, and think because it simply helped us survive.
Our minds do an incredible job to keep us alive, but it does not help
us thrive. It is concerned solely with our safety and survival, but not
our fulfillment or joy.
The mind‚Äôs job is to alert us of potential dangers in our
environment that may threaten our lives. It does its job so well that
not only will it scan our immediate surroundings for threats, but it will
even reference our backlog of past experiences to create
hypothetical scenarios and predict what it thinks could be future
potential dangers based on our memories.
None of this is wrong by any means. The mind is simply doing
what it was designed to do. When we don‚Äôt understand that its only
duty is to help us survive, then we will get angry and frustrated with
it. All conflict is derived from an innocent misunderstanding. Our
mind‚Äôs duty is to keep us alive. Our consciousness‚Äôs duty is to help
us feel fulfilled. Your soul is the reason why you‚Äôre even on this
journey in the first place ‚Äî to find peace, love, and joy for yourself.
Your mind has done an amazing job at what it was made to do,
but now you may relieve it of its job because we no longer live in the
wild where death could be right around the corner in a bush. If we
keep using our minds, we will constantly stay in a state of fight or
flight, anxiety, fear, frustration, depression, anger, resentment, and
all negative emotions because the mind thinks everything is a threat
to our very existence. If you want to be free, happy, peaceful, and full
of love, then you will need to let go of listening only to your mind and
go beyond it by tuning into something much greater that will help you
not just to survive, but to thrive.
CHAPTER 4
THOUGHTS VS. THINKING
‚ÄúStop thinking and end your problems.‚Äù ‚Äï Lao Tzu
Thoughts are the energetic, mental raw materials from which we use
to create everything in the world. We can‚Äôt experience anything
without thought. It‚Äôs important to know that thoughts are a noun and
aren‚Äôt something that we do, but something we have. A thought
takes no effort or force on our end, and it is something that just
happens. We also cannot control what thoughts pop into our minds.
The source of thoughts comes from something that is beyond our
minds ‚Äî the Universe, if you will.
Thinking, on the other hand, is the act of thinking about our
thoughts. This takes a significant amount of energy, effort, and
willpower (which is a finite resource). Thinking is actively engaging
with the thoughts in your mind. You don‚Äôt have to engage with each
thought in your mind, but when you do, that is thinking.
Thinking is the root cause of all our psychological suffering.
Now you might be wondering, where do positive thoughts fit into
the picture? Positive thoughts, or thoughts that feel good, are not a
result of thinking. They are, instead, generated by our natural state
of peace, love, and joy. They are a byproduct of a state of being, not
a state of thinking. We will go into depth about this in the next
chapter.
For now, let‚Äôs do a quick thought experiment.
I‚Äôll ask you a question and all you need to do is to be aware of
what you‚Äôre experiencing, and we‚Äôll review what happened after.
What is the dream amount of money you want to be making a
year?
Pause here and wait for an answer to surface.
Give yourself about 30-60 seconds to think about your answer of
how much money you want to be making in a year.
Don‚Äôt move on to the next step until you‚Äôve had a decently sized
train of thought about how much you want to make.
Now take that amount and multiply that by 5.
What do you think about this new dream goal for your income
when we multiplied it by 5?
Take at least another 30-60 seconds to become aware of how
you‚Äôre feeling when you think about that and see what other thinking
comes up for you as you feel your emotions.
Don‚Äôt move on until you‚Äôve done the above.
Okay, let‚Äôs bring it back in and review what happened.
After I asked the first question of what is the dream amount of
money you want to be making per year, within a few seconds an
answer popped up in your mind. That is a thought. Notice how
quickly and effortlessly that came to you.
After an answer popped into your mind, I asked you to think about
your answer. What happened once I asked you to think about your
answer?
If you‚Äôre like most people, you probably went on a wild
rollercoaster once you began thinking about the thought.
You might have been thinking how there‚Äôs no way you can make
that much, no one in your family is making that much money, you
don‚Äôt know how to make that much, it‚Äôs stupid to want that much
money or that it makes you greedy.
Notice how you felt when you were thinking about those thoughts.
Most likely it didn‚Äôt feel that great, but that is okay, and I‚Äôll show
you what you can do about it soon.
This is a prime example of thoughts versus thinking.
If I ask you a question, you will 100% have a thought that pops
into your mind.
Thoughts are not inherently bad. Remember that they are the
energetic mental raw materials from which we create in the world.
The moment we think about our thoughts is when we begin to get
taken on an emotional rollercoaster. When we think about our
thoughts, we begin to judge and criticize the thoughts and
experience all sorts of internal emotional turmoil.
When I asked you how much you wanted to make, you had a
thought about the amount. That thought was neutral and didn‚Äôt cause
any emotional toil. In fact, you might have felt expansive and excited.
It was only when you began thinking about that thought of how much
you wanted to make which is what caused the self-doubt,
unworthiness, anxiety, anger, guilt, or any other emotion you may
have experienced.
This is what I mean by thinking is the root of all of our suffering.
Having the initial thought of how much you wanted to make didn‚Äôt
cause any suffering until you began thinking about the thought of
how much you wanted to make.
It is not necessary to think about our thoughts or to judge them. It
does us no good to do so. We may think that thinking is helping us,
but all it‚Äôs really doing is causing us to feel all of these negative,
unwanted emotions and making us create reasons as to why we
can‚Äôt do it or why we shouldn‚Äôt want it.
The only thing that was useful and helpful was the initial thought
that popped into your mind when I first asked how much you wanted
to make. All of the thinking that happened after was destructive and
unhelpful.
Thoughts create. Thinking destroys.
The reason thinking destroys is because as soon as we begin to
think about the thoughts, we cast our own limiting beliefs,
judgements, criticisms, programming, and conditioning onto the
thought, thinking of infinite reasons as to why we can‚Äôt do it and why
we can‚Äôt have it.
Without thinking, we prevent all negative programming and
judgements from tarnishing the initial thought of what you want to
create.
If I asked you what are some ways you could make the amount of
money you want, if you sat there long enough, you‚Äôll experience the
same phenomenon of having random thoughts pop into your head of
ways you could make it happen.
These are thoughts of creation. Thoughts are inherently infinite,
expansive, and energetically positive. You‚Äôll know you are having
thoughts from the divine when you feel positive emotions, feel lighter,
and alive.
As soon as you begin thinking about those thoughts of the ways
you can make the money you want, you‚Äôll immediately feel heavy,
restricted, limited, along with a whole onslaught of negative
emotions. This is how you‚Äôll know if you‚Äôre thinking.
I use my feelings as an internal radar that tells me whether I‚Äôm
getting direct downloads of thoughts from the Universe or if I‚Äôm in my
head thinking about my thoughts.
You can only ever feel what you‚Äôre thinking, so feelings and
emotions are like an intuitive internal dashboard which tells me if I‚Äôm
thinking too much or not.
If I‚Äôm having a lot of negative emotions, I know that I‚Äôm thinking
too much. This is another example of how we‚Äôre naturally built for
success.
Below is a chart that compares Thinking vs. Thoughts to help you
identify which one is which within your mind:

CHAPTER 5
IF WE CAN ONLY FEEL WHAT WE'RE THINKING,
DON'T WE NEED TO THINK POSITIVELY TO FEEL
THAT WAY?
‚ÄúWe are ever only one thought away from peace, love, and joy ‚Äî
which come from a state of no thought.‚Äù ‚Äî Dicken Bettinger
There is a caveat that I haven't mentioned yet to the principle that we
can only feel what we're thinking. The more accurate way of
describing it is that we can only ever feel negative emotions when
we are thinking.
The goal isn't necessarily to completely stop feeling negative
emotions. Some of the negative emotions can be helpful, such as
feeling fearful when deciding to walk down a dark alley alone with no
one else in sight.
These negative emotions are only helpful to us in terms of
survival, but if we don't constantly encounter life or death situations,
negative emotions are more unhelpful than helpful for most of us.
We're going to be moving forward with the context that we're not
struggling for physical survival, so we'll be using the context that
negative emotions are not necessary most of the time.
When I mention that we can only ever feel what we're thinking,
most people assume that we must think positive to feel positive
emotions.
Instead of convincing you if this is true or not, let's do another
thought experiment so you can experience the truth for yourself.
Recall a time when you felt the most joy and love you've ever felt
in your life and feel the feelings that you felt at that time as much as
you can for at least 30 seconds.
What kinds of thoughts were going through your mind at that peak
moment when you felt the most joy and love? (I'm not asking what
you were doing at the time, but what thoughts were going through
your head at that exact moment.)
For many people that answer this, they realize that they didn't
have any thoughts during that exact moment. For others, they say
that the thought was that they were so grateful or happy.
For those that answered that they had the thought that they were
grateful, did you feel that joy and love before you had that thought or
after?
Take 10-15 seconds to answer that question before moving on.
What insights and epiphanies did you have?
What's crazy is that most people didn't have any thoughts going
through their mind when they felt the happiest and the most amount
of love in their lives. For those that had the thought that they were
grateful, they felt that way before having that thought.
If they had that thought, it happened after they felt the feelings, so
the thought could not have produced the feeling.
This brings us to another truth: you do not have to have
thoughts or think to feel positive emotions.
The beautiful part about truth is that it needs no justification
because it can be experienced right here right now. It doesn't need
to be proven or rationalized to you and you experienced this truth
firsthand by the experiment we just did.
Here's why we don't need to have thoughts or think to feel positive
emotions like joy and love.
Our natural state of being IS joy, love, ecstasy, freedom, and
gratitude. This may be hard to believe because if it's natural, why
don't we feel that way all the time? I'll answer this in a bit.
If we want to see the natural state of anything, one of the best
ways is to look at nature and the state of it in its infancy (before it is
affected and conditioned by its environment).
For example, let's look at the natural state of a baby. What is a
baby's natural and default state (assuming the baby wasn't abused,
neglected, or had any physical issues)? Are babies naturally
stressed, anxious, fearful, and self-conscious? Or are they naturally
in a state of bliss, happiness, and love?
Our natural state of being is joy, love, and peace. Therefore, any
thinking that we do will only take us away from those natural states
of being, which is why whenever we feel extremely stressed, we are
having a LOT of thinking going on. The strength of the negative
emotion we feel is in direct proportion to how much thinking we are
doing in the moment.
On the other hand, the intensity of the positive emotion we feel is
inversely proportional to the amount of thinking we are doing in the
moment. In other words, the less thinking we have going on, the
stronger the positive emotion we feel in the present.
To see the truth in this, recall a few other memories you had when
you were extremely stressed and anxious and see how much
thinking was going on at the time.
Take about 1-2 minutes to do this.
Then recall a few memories where you were at your happiest or
felt the most joy and love and see how much thinking you had going
on at that time.
Take another 1-2 minutes to do this before moving on to really
experience and internalize the truth of what you see.
An analogy that my coach taught me that helped crystallize this
concept was to imagine our mind has a speedometer (like in a car),
but instead of miles per hour, it is thoughts per minute. The more
thinking we have going on, the higher the ‚Äúthought-o-meter‚Äù goes,
and if we have enough thinking going on, it'll go into the red zone.
This is when we feel extremely stressed, burned out, frustrated, and
angry.
It is not the content of our thinking that causes us stress, but that
we are thinking, period. The amount of thinking we have going on is
directly correlated to the magnitude of stress and negative emotions
we are experiencing at any given moment. When you're
experiencing a lot of frustration, stress, anxiety, or any negative
emotions, just know that it is because you're thinking, and the
intensity of those emotions is directly correlated to how much
thinking is going on.
Therefore, it's not WHAT we're thinking about that is causing
us suffering, but THAT we are thinking.
To summarize, we do not have to try to "think positive" to
experience love, joy, bliss, and any positive emotions we want
because it is our natural state to feel those emotions. The only times
we don't naturally feel these emotions is when we begin to think
about the thoughts we're having, thus blocking the direct connection
to Infinite Intelligence and we feel stressed, anxious, depressed, and
fearful. It is not about the content of our thinking, but that we're
thinking, which is the root cause of our suffering. The intensity of the
negative emotions is directly correlated to the amount of thinking we
have going on in the present. The less thinking we have, the more
space we create for positive emotions to naturally surface.
CHAPTER 6
HOW THE HUMAN EXPERIENCE IS CREATED -
THE THREE PRINCIPLES
‚ÄúIf the only thing people learned was not to be afraid of their
experience, that alone would change the world.‚Äù ‚Äî Sydney Banks
At its fundamental level, the human experience is created by these
three principles: Universal Mind, Consciousness, and Thought.
These three principles work together to allow us to experience
everything we do in life and if one of the three is missing, we
wouldn't be able to experience anything. These principles were first
discovered by Sydney Banks and now I have the humbling privilege
to share them with you.
Understanding these three principles enables us to know how we
can alleviate ourselves from our suffering, but also allows us to
create from Source.
Universal Mind
Universal Mind is the Intelligence behind all living things. It is the
life force and energy that is in all things. It is how an acorn knows
how to grow into a tree, how the planets know how to stay in orbit,
and how our bodies know how to heal itself when we get a cut. It's
how our bodies know how to self-regulate and keep us alive without
us having to manually do everything like breathing and beating our
heart. The Intelligence that knows how to do all of this and is in all
things is called the Universal Mind. Many people call this God,
Infinite Intelligence, the Quantum Field, Source, and other names.
This is where Thoughts come from as well as everything else in the
Universe. All things are connected by Universal Mind. There is no
separation between anything, and any time there seems to be
separation between things, it is merely an illusion of our thinking.
When we are connected to Universal Mind, we feel whole, fulfilled,
filled with love, joy, peace, and inspiration. It is only when we begin
thinking (believing the illusion or ego) that we block this flow of
Universal Mind and begin to feel separated, frustrated, lonely, angry,
resentful, sad, depressed, and fearful.
Universal Consciousness
Universal Consciousness is the collective consciousness of all
things. It is what allows us to be aware that we exist and aware of
our thoughts. Without Universal Consciousness, we wouldn't be able
to experience anything. Our five senses would have no use because
there's nothing to be aware of. This is what brings things to life and
makes them perceivable to us.
Universal Thought
Universal Thought is the raw material of the Universe from which
we can create from. It is our ability to think and create form from the
energy of the Universal Mind.
It's the object we can perceive through Consciousness. Without
Thought, we would have nothing to be aware of. Thought is like the
DVD that contains all the information for us to be able to watch the
movie on the TV. The TV and DVD player is like Consciousness ‚Äî it
allows us to have a mechanism to bring the information on the DVD
to life for us to be able to watch and experience the movie. The
electricity that's needed to power the DVD player and TV is like
Universal Mind in the sense that it is the invisible energy/force that
connects and powers all things. It is the Source from which
everything can work and function.
CHAPTER 7
IF THINKING IS THE ROOT CAUSE OF OUR
SUFFERING, HOW DO WE STOP THINKING?
‚ÄúA crowded mind leaves no space for a peaceful heart.‚Äù ‚Äî Christine
Evangelou
Heaven and Hell: A Zen Parable
A tough, brawny samurai once approached a Zen master who was
deep in meditation. Impatient and discourteous, the samurai
demanded in his husky voice so accustomed to forceful yelling, ‚ÄúTell
me the nature of heaven and hell.‚Äù
The Zen master opened his eyes, looked the samurai in the face,
and replied with a certain scorn, ‚ÄúWhy should I answer to a shabby,
disgusting, despondent slob like you? A worm like you, do you think I
should tell you anything? I can‚Äôt stand you. Get out of my sight. I
have no time for silly questions.‚Äù
The samurai could not bear these insults. Consumed by rage, he
drew his sword and raised it to sever the master‚Äôs head at once.
Looking straight into the samurai‚Äôs eyes, the Zen master tenderly
declared, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs hell.‚Äù
The samurai froze. He immediately understood that anger had
him in its grip. His mind had just created his own hell ‚Äî one filled
with resentment, hatred, self-defense, and fury. He realized that he
was so deep in his torment that he was ready to kill somebody.
The samurai‚Äôs eyes filled with tears. Setting his sword aside, he
put his palms together and obsequiously bowed in gratitude for this
insight.
The Zen master gently acknowledged with a delicate smile, ‚ÄúAnd
that‚Äôs heaven.‚Äù
It's not possible to just entirely stop thinking, but what we can do
is reduce the time we spend thinking so that it gets smaller and
smaller each day that passes. Eventually we can get to the point
where we spend most of our day not caught up in our thinking and
live in a blissful state most of the time.
When we say that we want to stop thinking, many people assume
that we are trying to stop all thoughts in general. This isn't what we're
trying to do. Now that you know the difference between thoughts and
thinking, we are working on allowing thoughts to come and flow
through us while we minimize the thinking about those thoughts that
emerge.
The most interesting and almost paradoxical thing about stopping
our thinking is that we don't have to do anything to minimize it other
than to be aware of it. By us becoming aware that we are thinking
and that it is the root cause of all our suffering, it automatically
makes us conscious to that fact and we become detached to it,
allowing it to settle and pass. This takes almost no effort and is done
through pure presence in the moment.
Here‚Äôs an analogy from one of my mentors that illustrates this
concept:
Imagine I give you a bowl of cloudy, dirty, murky water. If I asked
you, how you would make the water clear, how would you do it?
Take 15 seconds to see what answers you come up with before
moving on.
Most people say something along the lines of filtering the water or
even boiling it. What most people don't realize is that if we let the
bowl of dirty water sit for a period of time, we can see that the dirt
begins to settle on its own in the water and after a while, the water
becomes clear on its own.
This is how our minds also work. If we let our thinking sit without
disturbing it by trying to "filter" or "boil" it, the thinking will settle down
on its own and our minds will become free from thinking. The natural
state of water is clear, and the natural state of our minds is also
clear, if we do not disturb it.
If life begins to feel unclear, disorganized, stressful and you're not
sure what to do next, you now know that it's only because your
thinking is stirring up the dirt, making your mind cloudy and difficult to
see ahead. You can use this as an indicator to help you realize that
you're thinking way too much.
Once we become aware of the fact that we are only feeling what
we're thinking and that thinking is the root cause of our unpleasant
experience, we see it for what it truly is. Then we allow it to settle by
giving it space, and slowly we will see how we begin to have a clear
mind again.
You can also compare thinking to quicksand. The more that we
fight our thinking, the more it amplifies the negative emotions and the
worse it gets. The same is true for quicksand. If we‚Äôre in quicksand,
the way out isn‚Äôt to fight it. If we panic and frantically try to fight it, it
only makes things worse by tightening the grip it has on us and
pulling us under faster. The only way out is to stop struggling and
allowing the natural buoyancy of your body to take over to bring you
back up to the surface with ease. The only way to break free from
our thinking is to let go and trust that our natural inner wisdom will
guide us back to clarity and peace like it always has.
If you find yourself fluctuating between thinking and non-thinking,
know that it is completely okay and quite normal. There is no way
that we can remain in a state of non-thinking every second of every
day and if we try to make that a goal, we will cause ourselves to
suffer by forcing ourselves back into thinking again.
We are spiritual, infinite beings having a physical, finite
experience. Because of this, we are literally a living gateway
between the human and the divine, so we will naturally oscillate
between the two states of feeling anxious/stressed and
joyful/peaceful. We cannot control or prevent the oscillation between
thinking and non-thinking, but we can minimize the time spent in
thinking and thus creating more moments where we do feel joyful,
peaceful, passionate, and full of love.
Although not being able to control when we begin to think can
seem like we are cursed with an inevitable fate, it is not something to
worry about because we can always return to the state of non-
thinking. It is just a part of our beautiful human experience.
What can give us true peace is knowing that we always have this
state of pure peace, love, and fulfillment underneath any thinking
that we may ever have at any given moment. That beautiful state we
always want is something we can never lose, but only forget. But just
because we can forget it doesn't mean it's not there. Just like when it
becomes night and the sun sets, we know that the sun is always
there, we just can't see it. If we thought when the sun sets that it may
never come back, then understandably we will have a lot of anxious
and fearful thoughts. The same is true for our state of being.
We are ever really one moment away from remembering that
we always have that infinite well of clarity, love, joy, peace, and
fulfillment. We will forget sometimes, but when we do remember
and realize that we are caught up in our thinking when we
experience negative emotions, that alone will allow us to return back
home to our natural beautiful state. All we have to do is remember it,
know that this is just our thinking, and have peace knowing that the
sun is not gone forever and that it will rise again soon enough.
Having that understanding will allow us to also appreciate the
nighttime for its existence and role in the Universe. From that we can
see how it is meant to be a part of our human experience and begin
to cherish its beauty as much as the sun.
CHAPTER 8
HOW CAN WE POSSIBLY THRIVE IN THE WORLD
WITHOUT THINKING?
‚ÄúAnxiety is thought without control. Flow is control without thought.‚Äù
‚Äî James Clear
Here‚Äôs a question that will guide you to an insight about this
question:
What thoughts are going through your head when you're doing
your absolute best work where you're fully captivated and entranced
by what you're doing in the moment?
Take about 15 seconds to wait for an answer to pop up before
moving on.
If you still haven't had the insight or epiphany from the answer,
here's another question that may point you in the right direction:
When you are loving what you do so much and are completely
engrossed in it that you lose all sense of time and space (aka when
you're in a state of complete flow), what thoughts are going through
your mind as you're in the state of flow in the moment?
Pause here and wait for the answer to arise (give it about 30-60
seconds for the insight to come in).
When you are doing your best work and are in a total state of flow,
where there is no separation between you or the work you are doing,
you are having no thoughts in the moment. And if you are having
thoughts, it's just flowing right through you without you having to
think about it. In other words, the state of peak performance for
humans can be described as the state of non-thinking. It may seem
crazy, but we do our best work when we aren't thinking, and you just
proved it with your own experience.
Here's another example that will help illuminate the truth of this
topic. When professional or even Olympic athletes are competing, do
you think they are thinking and overanalyzing every single thing
that's happening during the game? What thoughts or thinking do you
think is going on during the competition for them? The highest
performing athletes will describe when they are in their peak state
that they are in "the zone". This "zone" is the state of flow or the
state of non-thinking.
In Japanese culture, they have a beautiful word to describe this
phenomenon: mushin.
Here is the definition from Shotokantimes:
‚ÄúMushin is achieved when [the] mind is free of random thoughts,
free of anger, free of fear, and particularly free of ego. It applies
during combat, and or other facets of life. When mushin is achieved
during combat there is an absence of loose or rambling thoughts. It
leaves the practitioner free to act and react without hesitation. He
reacts according to all of the study and training that has brought the
karateka to this point. Relying on, not what you think should be your
next move, but on what your trained, instinctive, subconscious
reaction directs you to do.‚Äù
After practice, thinking hinders the performance of athletes and
the same is true for everyone. We only hesitate, are reluctant, have
doubts, insecurities, and fears only when we begin thinking and
over-analyzing. We function and perform our best and embody our
full potential the moment we enter a state of non-thinking. Without
thinking, we are free from limitations of the ego and are able to
create the most incredible things in the world. I am not asking you to
adopt this belief, but to try it and experience it for yourself so that you
gain the insight to make it your own.
CHAPTER 9
IF WE STOP THINKING, WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT
OUR GOALS, DREAMS & AMBITIONS?
‚ÄúThere are no limitations to the mind except those we acknowledge.‚Äù
‚Äî Napoleon Hill
I think, therefore I suffer.
When I finally understood that thinking was the root cause of all of
my suffering, I was jumping up and down, exhilarated, relieved and
grateful for discovering the true reason for everything negative I've
experienced in my life. This ecstasy was short-lived though because
soon after the exuberance settled, the next thoughts popped into my
mind:
If thinking is the root cause of all my suffering and I just stop
thinking, how do I live my life now? What about all of my goals,
dreams, and ambitions? Do I stop wanting things in life? Will I just
devolve into a couch potato and not do anything with my life
anymore?
In case you were wondering, yes, I am telepathic and yes, I can
read your mind. Just kidding, but if you are wondering how I wrote
the exact or very similar questions and know what thoughts you most
likely have right now, it's because I am human also, contrary to
popular belief. All of us are going through similar journeys of
awakening to our True Selves, so rest assured that many people are
having the exact same thoughts you are having right now as you
come to see your true magnificence.
Now back to the question of what we do about our goals, dreams,
and ambitions if we stop thinking. As I pondered on these questions,
an incredible amount of fear and anxiety began to surface because I
thought that I would have to give all of it up and become a monk in
the middle of the mountains.
I was definitely not ready to do that. As much as I wish I were that
enlightened and detached from my life, I genuinely enjoyed being in
the world, experiencing the fullness of life with other people, even if a
large portion of my life was filled with suffering.
Here's what I've discovered about what to do with our goals and
dreams with this new understanding. As we've mentioned in previous
chapters, there's a difference between thoughts versus thinking. The
source of thoughts and the source of thinking are different, and the
source is what will dictate whether it causes suffering or not.
Similarly, where our goals and dreams come from will determine
whether we feel great about pursuing them or not. Like everything in
this world, there is nothing inherently good or bad, only our thinking
makes it so. Goals, dreams, and ambitions are not good or bad, so
it's not really an either-or situation, but more about where those
goals are coming from.
There are two sources of goals: goals created out of
inspiration and goals created out of desperation.
When goals are created out of desperation, we feel a large sense
of scarcity and urgency. It feels heavy, like a burden, we may even
feel daunted by the colossal task we've just committed ourselves to,
imposter syndrome and self-doubt begin to manifest, and we always
feel like we never have enough time for anything. We go about our
life frantically, desperately searching for answers and ways that we
can accomplish our goal faster, always looking externally, never
feeling enough or that we can ever get enough. Worst of all, if we
happen to accomplish our goal, within a few hours or days
afterwards, all of those same feelings of lack begin to resurface. We
begin not feeling content with what we have done, unable to savor
our accomplishments and because what we did never feels like it‚Äôs
enough, we feel that same way about ourselves. Not knowing what
else to do, we look around for guidance externally to see what others
are doing and see they're continuing to do the same thing. Thus, we
go ahead and proceed to set another goal out of desperation in an
attempt to escape all of the negative feelings gnawing away at our
soul. When we dig a little deeper into these types of goals we set,
they are all typically ‚Äúmeans goals‚Äù and not ‚Äúend goals‚Äù. In other
words, the goals we set in this state of desperation are all a means
to an end. There's always a reason we want to accomplish the goal
and it's always for something else. For example, we want to create a
multi-million-dollar business because we want financial freedom, or
we want to quit our job so that we can escape the stress and anxiety
that comes from it. We feel like we HAVE to do these things instead
of WANT to. Goals created from desperation are typically "realistic"
and created from analyzing our past and what we think to be
"plausible" in the moment. It feels very confining and limiting.
Although these types of goals and dreams may excite us in the
moment, as soon as we begin to try to create it, we feel a lack, and
we are desperate to bring the dream to life. Paradoxically, if we do
end up achieving a goal created out of desperation, we end up
feeling even more empty than we did before it. The next "logical"
thing we tend to do is to set an even bigger goal out of even greater
desperation to hopefully make us feel whole inside.
This is how most of us set our goals and how we live our lives. I'm
also not saying this to criticize or judge at all, but to reveal the reality
of it. The only reason why I was able to describe it in painful and
excruciating detail was because that was my life.
Here's the good news: it's not your fault that you set goals that
way if you are and there's a way out. It's through creating goals and
dreams out of inspiration instead of desperation.
When we create goals out of inspiration versus desperation, it is a
completely different story. In this state, we are creating because we
feel deeply moved, inspired, and expansive. It feels like a calling
rather than an obligation. It is like there's a powerful force of life
coming from within us, wanting to be expressed through us to be
made manifested into the physical world. This is why painters paint,
why dancers dance, why writers write and why singers sing, even if
they never get paid or make a living from it. We feel pulled by a force
to create something. We gravitate towards it. We feel compelled to
do it. When we feel like this, we are creating from a place of
abundance instead of lack.
Most surprising of all is that in this state, we are creating not for
any reason at all, other than because we simply want to. We don't
create because we feel like we HAVE to. We create because we
simply want to and there's no other reason. We aren't creating these
goals so that we can do something else or use it as a means to get
something else we want. This creating comes from a place of
wholeness and abundance. It's an overflowing of love and joy for life.
This is the reason why most of us want or have kids. It's not so that
we can milk our kids for their money once they're old enough to work
and hopefully use them as a retirement plan. We want to have kids
because we want to share the abundance of what we have with
them, and it comes from a place of sharing what we have lots of
versus trying to get something out of them.
This feeling of deep inspiration is incredibly difficult to describe
because it does not come from this world. It really doesn't come from
us, but through us from something greater than us. I like to call this
feeling divine inspiration because the ideas and vision we have of
what we want to create seem to be far bigger than we could have
possibly imagined or come up with ourselves. Since divine
inspiration doesn't come from us but from something greater, it
doesn't analyze or rely on past data or what you or anyone in the
world has already accomplished. Divine inspiration is what happens
when groundbreaking creations and inventions are created that
seemed to be impossible not too long ago. It knows no boundaries,
limits, or constraints. It is an incredibly expansive force that
energizes and lifts us, making us feel like we're "high" on life. In this
state, we feel whole, complete, filled with unconditional love, joy, and
peace. We don't analyze, compare, criticize, judge, or rationalize
anything, but instead we truly live, love, share, give, create, grow,
and nourish. It really is one of the greatest feelings we can
experience, and it is truly a gift that we can experience the divine as
humans (and it's because we're from the same source).
Everyone has experienced this deep feeling and desire to create
something marvelous in the world that's out of pure inspiration and
not desperation. Before moving on to the next paragraph, I
encourage you to test this theory. Pause here and spend a few
minutes thinking about times in your life where you felt an
overwhelming feeling and desire to create something magnificent
because you felt deeply inspired and called to. It doesn't matter if
you actually created it or not, but just think of a time where you felt
that feeling to create out of inspiration.
Isn't that just one of the most amazing feelings in the entire world?
Most of us feel this divine inspiration, but then suppress it as soon as
we begin thinking about doing it. We begin to think ourselves into
doubt, rationalize why we can't do it, tell ourselves that it is
unrealistic, how we should focus on more important things, and that
we're not good enough to do it. As soon as we begin to think about
the thought of us wanting to create, it completely shuts off the source
of that inspiration and we go back to living life as usual. When we cut
off that source, we also cut off the feelings of abundance,
exuberance, ecstasy, joy, pure unconditional love, and go back to the
feelings of doubt, anxiety, frustration, sadness, and feel confined,
stuck, and frustrated with our lives.
We can only ever follow one calling at a time, either inspiration or
desperation in the present moment. The two cannot coexist at the
same time, but we can fluctuate between the two depending on how
much thinking is going on.
When we stop thinking, we don't stop having goals and dreams,
we actually fall back into our true nature and begin to create goals
and dreams out of inspiration versus desperation. We begin to allow
thoughts from the Universe to come into our mind that lead us to
divine inspiration to create something that has never been created
before in the world. When we follow divine inspiration, we feel alive,
whole, joy, love, peace, and fulfillment.
So how can we tell when a goal or dream is created out of
inspiration or desperation?
A simple way to know if a goal or dream is created out of
inspiration is to remember the distinction between thoughts and
thinking. Goals and dreams that come in the form of thought are
created out of inspiration. Goals and dreams that come from thinking
are created out of desperation.
Typically, when we think, we'll analyze, judge, criticize, rationalize,
and use our past to try to create our new goals, but this form of
creating goals feels extremely restricting and limiting. We don't
typically feel good when creating these types of goals and when
we're pursuing them, we do not feel great either, since it's all out of
desperation.
Another way to identify the two is to sense how you feel
energetically. Goals and dreams created out of desperation will feel
very heavy, draining, confining, and empty. We tend to feel a lot of
scarcity, fear, and stress, like we HAVE to do it or that we are
obligated to. With these types of goals, it seems like if we do not
accomplish it, that there will be dire consequences, hence the high
pressure and stakes (I'm sure you can see now how this can create
the feeling of desperation). Moreover, we feel like we're trying to
accomplish these goals to escape our current situation and get out of
something. Our goals created in this state are typically means goals,
meaning that we want to achieve these goals so that we can do
something else afterwards, such as having the goal to quit our job.
Most likely you'll have this goal because you want to go do
something you actually enjoy, but you can see how the goal of
quitting your job is just a means goal for you to go do something
else. Or having a goal of making $1 million is typically set because
you want to have financial freedom and go travel the world. These
goals are always a means to an end and not the end itself. There's
always a reason that we want to accomplish these goals and it
makes us feel very empty inside.
I want to emphasize that none of these goals are inherently bad or
that we shouldn't have goals of wanting to make money or quitting
our jobs. If those goals are created from inspiration, that is
completely different. It just depends on the source of the goals and
not necessarily the goal itself. This is an important distinction to
make, otherwise you'll spend most of your time debating and
stressing yourself out over if this is the right goal for you or not.
There is no right or wrong goal, only goals created from inspiration or
desperation. It just depends on how you want to feel inside and
when you're aware of these two types of goals and how they
manifest, then you'll be able to feel blissful as you go about creating
amazing things in your life.
On the other hand, goals and dreams created out of inspiration
(which comes from thought) feel very light, energizing, uplifting, and
expansive. We tend to feel excited, joyful, and most importantly,
inspired. We don't feel like we HAVE to create it, but that we WANT
to. Instead of feeling like you NEED to do this, you feel inspired to.
There is virtually no pressure because we're not trying to get out of
something or escape our current situation by accomplishing this
goal. There is no scarcity or urgency because we don't feel like we're
creating from a place of lack, but instead from a place of abundance
and we just want to share it with the world. Since it's coming from
inspiration, we are not doing it to get something out of it so that we
can do something else. It's not a means goal, but simply an end in
and of itself. There is no "reason" we need to create it. We are not
creating so that we can feel whole, but we are creating because we
feel whole and want to give from that place, not expecting anything
from it.
I'm sure you can see the stark difference between the two now
and that you can tell which type your goals currently fall under. If
most of your goals fall under the category of desperation, don't worry
because most people have goals created from desperation, including
myself before I knew a better way.
So how do we create goals and dreams out of inspiration versus
desperation?
Creating goals and dreams from divine inspiration isn't something
you have to try to do. We naturally have thoughts of infinite
inspiration all the time. If you look at children, they naturally have the
wildest dreams and imaginations of what they want to do. It almost
doesn't even register in their minds that they can't do something
most of the time. The only difference between us and children is that
we have learned to shut down all these thoughts of inspiration which
contain our dreams, hopes, and goals that we truly want to see
manifested in the world. Our minds are filled more with reasons of
why we can't than thoughts of what we want to create.
We innately have an infinite flow of inspiration that comes through
us, but we block that flow as soon as we begin thinking about the
thoughts we have, which causes self-doubt, self-sabotage, and
anxiety. Think of the flow of inspiration to create like a river. The river
always flows until man puts something there to block it, like a dam.
Then when the dam is there, we ask why there are so many fish
dying, animals disappearing, and forests dwindling, when all we
need to do was return the river back to its natural state and
everything will be working perfectly fine, the way nature intended it
to.
You're encountering the CAST5 has been deprecated error because Scapy uses the cryptography library under the hood for certain operations like decryption or handling certain encrypted protocols, and a recent version of cryptography deprecated the CAST5 cipher.

But here‚Äôs the key thing:

You're not even using encryption in your script. The CAST5 warning/error likely stems from Scapy importing all crypto ciphers by default, not from your usage.
‚úÖ Fix Options
ü•á Option 1: Ignore the Warning

If it‚Äôs just a warning, and your graph still generates correctly:

It‚Äôs safe to ignore for now.
You can suppress it by running Python with warnings off:
python3 -W ignore your_script.py
üõ†Ô∏è Option 2: Downgrade cryptography

If it‚Äôs a hard error (breaking the script), downgrade the cryptography package to a version that still supports CAST5:

pip install "cryptography<42.0.0"
That should resolve the CAST5 issue while maintaining compatibility with Scapy.

üßº Option 3: Update Scapy (if it‚Äôs been patched)

Scapy may have patched this already:

pip install --upgrade scapy

No matter who you are, where you're from, what your background
is, what you've done and haven't done, what status or wealth you do
or don't have, Martian or not, you can find total peace, unconditional
love, complete fulfillment, and an abundance of joy in your life. I
promise that you are not the exception, even though it may seem like
it. Love knows no boundaries. An open mind and a willing heart are
all you need to receive every answer you've been looking for.
And yes, there are extremely practical implications and
byproducts of understanding what is inside of this book, which many
of my coaching clients have experienced, such as: a 2-5x increase in
income, exponential growth in their businesses, deeper and more
harmonious relationships, overcoming lifelong addictions, the
spontaneous disappearance of destructive habits, an increase in
health, vitality, and overall energy. Miracles like these occur every
day for many who understand the principles within this book. And
this is just the tip of the iceberg. If I were to just list some of the
improvements and results people have gotten from this
understanding, more than half of this book would just be stories of
such miracles that happen daily.
I am reluctant to mention any of these "external" results because
it is not the point of this book. These physical manifestations are the
byproduct of this inside-out understanding of how our experiences of
life work. In actuality, we only want these external results like money
and significance because we want to experience certain feelings
inside such as love, joy, peace, and fulfillment. The feeling is really
what we want in our lives, not the physical things, but the trap is that
we believe the physical things will give us those feelings. The secret
lies within the feeling.
This book will help guide you to understand how to uncover the
truth you already know inside and discover these feelings you've
been looking for your entire life.
Now let's get into the guide of how to go through this book.
Don‚Äôt read this book for information, read it for insight. Insight (or
wisdom) can only be found within. That is why it is called insight (in-
side). To find everything you're looking for in life, you must look
inside yourself and discover the wisdom that already exists within
you. All the answers lie deep within your soul. This book is merely a
guide to help you look in the right place. I truly admire anyone who
still has the hope that what they're looking for is still out there. This
means you have hope. Without hope, we have nothing, so the fact
that you're here, reading this now, is a testament to your faith,
courage, and strength. I know with one hundred percent certainty
that you will find what you're looking for if you continue down the
path you're on with the hope you have in your heart.
I want to make it clear that this book is not the only book that
contains truth. The truth lies within everyone and in everything. You
must look beyond the form (the physical) to see and experience the
truth (the spiritual). The words in this book are not truth. They point
TO the truth. Look beyond words to see the truth for yourself. Truth
cannot be intellectualized; it can only be experienced. The truth lies
within a feeling, which is why it cannot be formulated into a word.
If you want to find truth, look beyond the words, and look for a
feeling.
Many who discover the truth will describe the feeling as one of
complete peace, unconditional love, and an overwhelming amount of
joy. People also describe it as the most familiar unfamiliar feeling. It
feels like you're finally home. Look for that feeling, and everything
will be revealed to you. In this book, I will not say anything that you
don't already know deep inside your soul. This is why it will be a
familiar unfamiliar feeling when you experience the truth.
Don‚Äôt try to use your intellect to figure it out ‚Äî you won‚Äôt. As soon
as you intellectualize it, you've missed it. The truth does not come
from memorizing a sentence or two. A child can do that, but they will
not understand the truth. The truth comes in the form of a feeling.
From that feeling will come the wisdom and truth you‚Äôre looking for,
which will set you free. That's what we're all ultimately seeking, isn't
it?
What I will unveil to you in this book will seem simple. It will seem
almost too simple, and your brain (ego) will try to fight it or attempt to
make it more complex. It will think that it can‚Äôt be this simple. When
that time comes, I want you to remember that the truth is always
simple. What is complex can always be broken down into its smaller
counterparts. The truth cannot be broken down into smaller
constituents, which is what makes it truth. This is why truth is always
simple. If you want to find the truth, look for simplicity.
Approach this book with an open mind and a heart of pure
intention to know the truth and you'll receive everything you've been
searching for.
Before we move on, I want to take a moment to express my
deepest gratitude for you being here and sharing your time and
attention with me. Those are some of the most valuable life forces
you could give to another, so thank you for that gift to me, which you
are also giving to yourself. Never forget your own divinity because it
is only through our divinity that we have our humanity.
With Love & Light,
Joseph
CHAPTER 1
THE JOURNEY TO FINDING THE ROOT CAUSE
OF SUFFERING
"People have a hard time letting go of their suffering. Out of a fear of
the unknown, they prefer suffering that is familiar.‚Äù ‚Äï Thich Nhat
Hanh
There is an important distinction to make when speaking about
suffering. When I mention suffering in this book, I'm referring to
psychological and emotional suffering. There is a way in which, no
matter what happens in your life, you do not have to suffer
emotionally and psychologically.
I am not saying that what we go through is all in our heads or
made up. Terrible and unfortunate events happen to people every
single day. What I'm saying is that although we experience a lot of
pain in our lives, suffering is optional. In other words, pain is
unavoidable, but how we react to the events and circumstances that
happen in our lives is up to us, and that will dictate whether we suffer
or not.
Buddhists say that anytime we experience a negative event in our
lives, two arrows fly our way. Being physically struck by an arrow is
painful. Being struck by a second emotional arrow is even more
painful (suffering).
The Buddha explained, ‚ÄúIn life, we can‚Äôt always control the first
arrow. However, the second arrow is our reaction to the first. The
second arrow is optional.‚Äù
When I first heard of this quote from Buddha a few years back, I
was confounded because although I understood what he meant, I
didn't know how I could apply this in my own life. If anyone were
given the clear choice of suffering and not suffering, I don't think
anyone in their right mind would choose to suffer.
How can I just choose not to suffer? If it were as easy as that I
don't think anyone would be suffering anymore. It wasn't until years
later that I came across a new understanding of where suffering
comes from that I was able to stop it at its source.
As I began my journey of self-improvement, I came across a
myriad of different teachings, studies, and methods to help people
overcome their problems. I read dozens, if not hundreds of books,
studied psychology, went to therapists, listened to many different
thought leaders, tried changing my habits, waking up at 4am,
changing my diet, becoming more structured and disciplined,
shadow work, studying personality types, meditating daily, going on
spiritual retreats, following spiritual masters, and researching
different ancient religions.
If you name it, I've probably tried it. I was desperate to find an
answer because I wanted to know how to stop suffering in my own
life as well as help others do the same. Although some of these
things did help me improve incrementally, it didn‚Äôt stop my suffering. I
still always felt extremely anxious, fearful, unfulfilled, irritated, angry,
frustrated, and heavy every day. Even after doing all of that, I still
didn't discover the answer and, if I'm being honest, I was even more
lost than before I started on this quest.
I felt purposeless, hopeless, and directionless. I didn't know what
to do anymore, where to look, or who to talk to. It wasn't until I was in
my darkest hour that a glimmer of hope began to lead me to the
light.
All of the sudden, after years and years of searching, I stumbled
upon one of my first mentors that taught me how to become a coach
and he revealed to me the answer of how I can alleviate my own
suffering.
The answer I discovered was in the understanding of how our
minds work and how the human experience is created.
CHAPTER 2
THE ROOT CAUSE OF ALL SUFFERING
‚ÄúOne who looks around him is intelligent, one who looks within him is
wise.‚Äù ‚Äï Matshona Dhliwayo
We live in a world of thought, not reality. Sydney Banks once said,
‚ÄúThought is not reality; yet it is through thought that our realities are
created.‚Äù Each of us lives through our own perceptions of the world,
which are vastly different from the person right next to us. An
example of this is that you could be sitting in a coffee shop having a
quarter-life existential crisis, completely stressed out of your mind
about how you have no idea what you‚Äôre doing with your life when it
seems like everyone else has theirs together, while the person next
to you is happily enjoying their freshly brewed drink while peacefully
people watching. You both are in the same exact coffee shop,
smelling the same aroma, surrounded by the same strangers, but
how the world looks to both of you couldn't be more different. Many
of us go through the exact same events or are in the same location
at the same time yet are having completely different experiences of
the world.
Here's another example of how we live in a world of thought and
not reality. If you walk up to 100 different people and ask each of
them what money means to them, how many different answers do
you think you'll get? Close to 100 different answers!
Money is technically the same thing, but it means something
different to each person. Money could mean time, freedom,
opportunity, security, peace of mind, or it could mean evil, greed, and
the reason why people commit crimes. For now, I'm not going to get
into which one is right or wrong (hint: there is no right or wrong
answer, but that's for a different chapter).
Another illustration of this concept is as follows: If you survey 100
different people and ask each of them what they think of our current
president, how many different answers do you think you'll get?
Even though it is the same exact person we're talking about, we
will get 100 different answers because most people live in their own
thoughts and perceptions of the world. The meaning (or thinking) we
give an event is what determines how we ultimately feel about it.
That meaning or thinking is the filter through which we see life from
then on ‚Äî because of this, we live through a perception of reality,
not in reality itself. Reality is that the event happened, with no
meaning, thinking, or interpretation of it.
Any meaning or thinking we give the event is on us and that is
how our perception of reality is created. This is how our experience
of life is created from the inside out.
It's not about the events that happen in our lives, but our
interpretation of them, which causes us to feel good or bad about
something. This is how people in third world countries can be
happier than people in first world countries and people in first world
countries can be more miserable than people in third world
countries.
Our feelings do not come from external events, but from our
own thinking about the events. Therefore, we can only ever feel
what we are thinking.
Let's hypothetically say that you really hate your job, and it causes
you an enormous amount of stress, anxiety, and frustration. It pains
you to even set foot in the building where you work and just thinking
about your job makes you furious. When you're thinking about your
job, you're just sitting there on a sofa with your family watching a TV
show together, but you are fuming at the thought of your job.
Everyone else is having a good time, except you.
In this moment, everyone else in your family is having a different
experience of life than you, even though the same event is
happening. Just the thought of work created a whole different
perception of reality, even though you're not physically at work.
If it were true that external events cause us to feel the way we feel
inside, then you should be a happy camper in your living room,
watching a funny TV show with your family every single time you do
this activity ‚Äî but that's not the case.
Now, you may be saying that you're only feeling this way because
an external event, your job, is causing you to feel stressed and
anxious. To that I'll ask the question, is it absolutely true that every
single person feels the exact same way about the job they're working
in?
Two different people can be doing the exact same job but will
have completely different experiences of that job. It can be the most
amazing experience and a dream job for one person but be another
person's worst nightmare and living hell. The only difference
between one person and the other is how they think about their job,
which determines how they ultimately feel about it.
Now let's go back to the original scenario of you hypothetically
hating your job. Remember how much stress, anxiety, and frustration
it causes you when you think about it?
Let's do a quick thought experiment about that by answering the
question below:
Who would you be without that thought that you hated your
job?
Take 1 minute to see what comes up for you and don't move on
until you do that.
If you don't overthink it and truly let the answers surface from
within you, without that thought, you will most likely feel and be
happy, peaceful, free, and light.
Without our usual thinking about a particular event or thing, our
experience of it completely alters. This is how we live in a world of
thought, not reality, and how our perception of reality is created from
the inside out, through our own thinking. With this new
understanding, you've just uncovered the cause of all our human
psychological suffering...
The root cause of our suffering is our own thinking.
Now before you throw this book across the room and light it on
fire, I'm not saying that this is all in our heads and that it isn't real.
Our perception of reality is very real. We will feel what we think, and
our feelings are real. That is completely undeniable. However, our
thinking will look like an inevitable, unchangeable reality to us until
we begin seeing how our reality is created. If we know that we can
only ever feel what we are thinking, then we know that we can
change our feelings by changing our thinking. Thus, we can change
our experience of life by knowing that it comes from our own
thinking. And if that is true, then we are ever only one thought away
from experiencing something different and transforming our entire
lives at any moment ‚Äî through a state of no thought.
In short, the moment we stop thinking is when our happiness
begins.
A Young Monk & the Empty Boat (A Zen Story About How
Thinking is the Cause of Our Own Suffering)
A long time ago, a young Zen monk was living in a small
monastery that was located in a forest which was near a small lake.
The monastery was occupied by a few senior monks while the rest
were newcomers and still had much to learn. The monks had many
obligations in the monastery, but one of the most important ones was
their daily routine where they had to sit down, close their eyes, and
meditate in silence for hours at a time.
After each meditation, they had to report their progress to their
mentor. The young monk had difficulty staying focused during his
meditation practice for a variety of reasons, which made him very
mad. After the young monk reported his progress, or better said, lack
of it, to his mentor, the elder monk asked the young monk a simple
question that had a hidden lesson, ‚ÄúDo you know what is really
making you angry?‚Äù The young monk replied, ‚ÄúWell, usually as soon
as I close my eyes and begin to meditate, there is someone moving
around, and I can‚Äôt focus. I get agitated that someone is disturbing
me even though they know that I‚Äôm meditating. How can they not be
more considerate? And then when I close my eyes again and try to
focus, a cat or a small animal might brush past and disturb me again.
By this point, even when the wind blows and the tree branches make
noise, I get angry. If that is not enough, the birds keep on chirping,
and I can‚Äôt seem to find any peace in this place.‚Äù
The elder monk simply pointed out to his pupil, ‚ÄúI see that you
become angrier with each interruption you encounter. This is exactly
the opposite of what is the point of your task when meditating. You
should find a way not to get angry with people, or animals, or any
other thing around you that disturbs you during your task.‚Äù After their
consultation, the young monk went out of the monastery and looked
around to find a place that would be quieter so that he could
meditate peacefully. He found such a place at the shore of the lake
that is nearby. He brought his mat, sat down, and started meditating.
But soon a flock of birds splashed down in the lake near where the
monk was meditating. Hearing their noise, the monk opened his
eyes to see what was going on.
Although the bank of the lake was quieter than the monastery,
there were still things that would disturb his peace and he again got
angry. Even though he didn‚Äôt find the peace he was looking for, he
kept returning to the lake. Then one day, the monk saw a boat tied at
the end of a small pier. And right then an idea hit him, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt I
take the boat, row it down to the middle of the lake and meditate
there? In the middle of the lake, there will be nothing to disturb me!‚Äù
He rowed the boat to the middle of the lake and started meditating.
As he had expected, there was nothing in the middle of the lake to
disturb him and he was able to meditate the whole day. At the end of
the day, he returned to the monastery. This continued for a couple of
days and the monk was thrilled that he had finally found a place to
meditate in peace. He hadn‚Äôt felt angry and could continue the
meditation practice in a calm manner.
On the third day, the monk sat in the boat, rowed to the middle of
the lake, and started meditating again. A few minutes later, he heard
some splashing of water and felt that the boat was rocking. He
started getting upset that even in the middle of the lake there was
someone or something disturbing him.
When he opened his eyes, he saw a boat heading straight
towards him. He shouted, ‚ÄúSteer your boat away, or else you will hit
my boat.‚Äù But the other boat kept coming straight at him and was just
a few feet away. He yelled again but nothing changed and so the
incoming boat hit the monk‚Äôs boat. Now he was furious. He
screamed, ‚ÄúWho are you, and why have you hit my boat in the
middle of this vast lake?‚Äù There was no answer. This made the
young monk even angrier.
He stood up to see who was in the other boat and to his surprise,
he found that there was no one in the boat.
The boat had probably drifted along in the breeze and had
bumped into the monk‚Äôs boat. The monk found his anger dissipating.
It was just an empty boat! There was no one to get angry at!
At that moment he remembered his mentors‚Äô question, ‚ÄúDo you
know what is really making you angry?‚Äù And then wondered, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not
other people, situations, or circumstances. It‚Äôs not the empty boat,
but my reaction to it that causes my anger. All the people or
situations that make me upset and angry are just like the empty boat.
They don‚Äôt have the power to make me angry without my own
reaction.‚Äù
The monk then rowed the boat back to the shore. He returned to
the monastery and started meditating along with the other monks.
There were still noises and disturbances around, but the monk
treated them as the ‚Äúempty boat‚Äù and continued to meditate
peacefully. When the elder monk saw the difference, he simply said
to the young monk, ‚ÄúI see that you have found what is really making
you angry and overcome that.‚Äù
CHAPTER 3
WHY DO WE EVEN THINK?
‚ÄúI think and think and think, I've thought myself out of happiness one
million times, but never once into it.‚Äù ‚Äî Jonathan Safran Foer
We as humans have evolved to develop a sophisticated ability to
rationalize, analyze, and think because it simply helped us survive.
Our minds do an incredible job to keep us alive, but it does not help
us thrive. It is concerned solely with our safety and survival, but not
our fulfillment or joy.
The mind‚Äôs job is to alert us of potential dangers in our
environment that may threaten our lives. It does its job so well that
not only will it scan our immediate surroundings for threats, but it will
even reference our backlog of past experiences to create
hypothetical scenarios and predict what it thinks could be future
potential dangers based on our memories.
None of this is wrong by any means. The mind is simply doing
what it was designed to do. When we don‚Äôt understand that its only
duty is to help us survive, then we will get angry and frustrated with
it. All conflict is derived from an innocent misunderstanding. Our
mind‚Äôs duty is to keep us alive. Our consciousness‚Äôs duty is to help
us feel fulfilled. Your soul is the reason why you‚Äôre even on this
journey in the first place ‚Äî to find peace, love, and joy for yourself.
Your mind has done an amazing job at what it was made to do,
but now you may relieve it of its job because we no longer live in the
wild where death could be right around the corner in a bush. If we
keep using our minds, we will constantly stay in a state of fight or
flight, anxiety, fear, frustration, depression, anger, resentment, and
all negative emotions because the mind thinks everything is a threat
to our very existence. If you want to be free, happy, peaceful, and full
of love, then you will need to let go of listening only to your mind and
go beyond it by tuning into something much greater that will help you
not just to survive, but to thrive.
CHAPTER 4
THOUGHTS VS. THINKING
‚ÄúStop thinking and end your problems.‚Äù ‚Äï Lao Tzu
Thoughts are the energetic, mental raw materials from which we use
to create everything in the world. We can‚Äôt experience anything
without thought. It‚Äôs important to know that thoughts are a noun and
aren‚Äôt something that we do, but something we have. A thought
takes no effort or force on our end, and it is something that just
happens. We also cannot control what thoughts pop into our minds.
The source of thoughts comes from something that is beyond our
minds ‚Äî the Universe, if you will.
Thinking, on the other hand, is the act of thinking about our
thoughts. This takes a significant amount of energy, effort, and
willpower (which is a finite resource). Thinking is actively engaging
with the thoughts in your mind. You don‚Äôt have to engage with each
thought in your mind, but when you do, that is thinking.
Thinking is the root cause of all our psychological suffering.
Now you might be wondering, where do positive thoughts fit into
the picture? Positive thoughts, or thoughts that feel good, are not a
result of thinking. They are, instead, generated by our natural state
of peace, love, and joy. They are a byproduct of a state of being, not
a state of thinking. We will go into depth about this in the next
chapter.
For now, let‚Äôs do a quick thought experiment.
I‚Äôll ask you a question and all you need to do is to be aware of
what you‚Äôre experiencing, and we‚Äôll review what happened after.
What is the dream amount of money you want to be making a
year?
Pause here and wait for an answer to surface.
Give yourself about 30-60 seconds to think about your answer of
how much money you want to be making in a year.
Don‚Äôt move on to the next step until you‚Äôve had a decently sized
train of thought about how much you want to make.
Now take that amount and multiply that by 5.
What do you think about this new dream goal for your income
when we multiplied it by 5?
Take at least another 30-60 seconds to become aware of how
you‚Äôre feeling when you think about that and see what other thinking
comes up for you as you feel your emotions.
Don‚Äôt move on until you‚Äôve done the above.
Okay, let‚Äôs bring it back in and review what happened.
After I asked the first question of what is the dream amount of
money you want to be making per year, within a few seconds an
answer popped up in your mind. That is a thought. Notice how
quickly and effortlessly that came to you.
After an answer popped into your mind, I asked you to think about
your answer. What happened once I asked you to think about your
answer?
If you‚Äôre like most people, you probably went on a wild
rollercoaster once you began thinking about the thought.
You might have been thinking how there‚Äôs no way you can make
that much, no one in your family is making that much money, you
don‚Äôt know how to make that much, it‚Äôs stupid to want that much
money or that it makes you greedy.
Notice how you felt when you were thinking about those thoughts.
Most likely it didn‚Äôt feel that great, but that is okay, and I‚Äôll show
you what you can do about it soon.
This is a prime example of thoughts versus thinking.
If I ask you a question, you will 100% have a thought that pops
into your mind.
Thoughts are not inherently bad. Remember that they are the
energetic mental raw materials from which we create in the world.
The moment we think about our thoughts is when we begin to get
taken on an emotional rollercoaster. When we think about our
thoughts, we begin to judge and criticize the thoughts and
experience all sorts of internal emotional turmoil.
When I asked you how much you wanted to make, you had a
thought about the amount. That thought was neutral and didn‚Äôt cause
any emotional toil. In fact, you might have felt expansive and excited.
It was only when you began thinking about that thought of how much
you wanted to make which is what caused the self-doubt,
unworthiness, anxiety, anger, guilt, or any other emotion you may
have experienced.
This is what I mean by thinking is the root of all of our suffering.
Having the initial thought of how much you wanted to make didn‚Äôt
cause any suffering until you began thinking about the thought of
how much you wanted to make.
It is not necessary to think about our thoughts or to judge them. It
does us no good to do so. We may think that thinking is helping us,
but all it‚Äôs really doing is causing us to feel all of these negative,
unwanted emotions and making us create reasons as to why we
can‚Äôt do it or why we shouldn‚Äôt want it.
The only thing that was useful and helpful was the initial thought
that popped into your mind when I first asked how much you wanted
to make. All of the thinking that happened after was destructive and
unhelpful.
Thoughts create. Thinking destroys.
The reason thinking destroys is because as soon as we begin to
think about the thoughts, we cast our own limiting beliefs,
judgements, criticisms, programming, and conditioning onto the
thought, thinking of infinite reasons as to why we can‚Äôt do it and why
we can‚Äôt have it.
Without thinking, we prevent all negative programming and
judgements from tarnishing the initial thought of what you want to
create.
If I asked you what are some ways you could make the amount of
money you want, if you sat there long enough, you‚Äôll experience the
same phenomenon of having random thoughts pop into your head of
ways you could make it happen.
These are thoughts of creation. Thoughts are inherently infinite,
expansive, and energetically positive. You‚Äôll know you are having
thoughts from the divine when you feel positive emotions, feel lighter,
and alive.
As soon as you begin thinking about those thoughts of the ways
you can make the money you want, you‚Äôll immediately feel heavy,
restricted, limited, along with a whole onslaught of negative
emotions. This is how you‚Äôll know if you‚Äôre thinking.
I use my feelings as an internal radar that tells me whether I‚Äôm
getting direct downloads of thoughts from the Universe or if I‚Äôm in my
head thinking about my thoughts.
You can only ever feel what you‚Äôre thinking, so feelings and
emotions are like an intuitive internal dashboard which tells me if I‚Äôm
thinking too much or not.
If I‚Äôm having a lot of negative emotions, I know that I‚Äôm thinking
too much. This is another example of how we‚Äôre naturally built for
success.
Below is a chart that compares Thinking vs. Thoughts to help you
identify which one is which within your mind:

CHAPTER 5
IF WE CAN ONLY FEEL WHAT WE'RE THINKING,
DON'T WE NEED TO THINK POSITIVELY TO FEEL
THAT WAY?
‚ÄúWe are ever only one thought away from peace, love, and joy ‚Äî
which come from a state of no thought.‚Äù ‚Äî Dicken Bettinger
There is a caveat that I haven't mentioned yet to the principle that we
can only feel what we're thinking. The more accurate way of
describing it is that we can only ever feel negative emotions when
we are thinking.
The goal isn't necessarily to completely stop feeling negative
emotions. Some of the negative emotions can be helpful, such as
feeling fearful when deciding to walk down a dark alley alone with no
one else in sight.
These negative emotions are only helpful to us in terms of
survival, but if we don't constantly encounter life or death situations,
negative emotions are more unhelpful than helpful for most of us.
We're going to be moving forward with the context that we're not
struggling for physical survival, so we'll be using the context that
negative emotions are not necessary most of the time.
When I mention that we can only ever feel what we're thinking,
most people assume that we must think positive to feel positive
emotions.
Instead of convincing you if this is true or not, let's do another
thought experiment so you can experience the truth for yourself.
Recall a time when you felt the most joy and love you've ever felt
in your life and feel the feelings that you felt at that time as much as
you can for at least 30 seconds.
What kinds of thoughts were going through your mind at that peak
moment when you felt the most joy and love? (I'm not asking what
you were doing at the time, but what thoughts were going through
your head at that exact moment.)
For many people that answer this, they realize that they didn't
have any thoughts during that exact moment. For others, they say
that the thought was that they were so grateful or happy.
For those that answered that they had the thought that they were
grateful, did you feel that joy and love before you had that thought or
after?
Take 10-15 seconds to answer that question before moving on.
What insights and epiphanies did you have?
What's crazy is that most people didn't have any thoughts going
through their mind when they felt the happiest and the most amount
of love in their lives. For those that had the thought that they were
grateful, they felt that way before having that thought.
If they had that thought, it happened after they felt the feelings, so
the thought could not have produced the feeling.
This brings us to another truth: you do not have to have
thoughts or think to feel positive emotions.
The beautiful part about truth is that it needs no justification
because it can be experienced right here right now. It doesn't need
to be proven or rationalized to you and you experienced this truth
firsthand by the experiment we just did.
Here's why we don't need to have thoughts or think to feel positive
emotions like joy and love.
Our natural state of being IS joy, love, ecstasy, freedom, and
gratitude. This may be hard to believe because if it's natural, why
don't we feel that way all the time? I'll answer this in a bit.
If we want to see the natural state of anything, one of the best
ways is to look at nature and the state of it in its infancy (before it is
affected and conditioned by its environment).
For example, let's look at the natural state of a baby. What is a
baby's natural and default state (assuming the baby wasn't abused,
neglected, or had any physical issues)? Are babies naturally
stressed, anxious, fearful, and self-conscious? Or are they naturally
in a state of bliss, happiness, and love?
Our natural state of being is joy, love, and peace. Therefore, any
thinking that we do will only take us away from those natural states
of being, which is why whenever we feel extremely stressed, we are
having a LOT of thinking going on. The strength of the negative
emotion we feel is in direct proportion to how much thinking we are
doing in the moment.
On the other hand, the intensity of the positive emotion we feel is
inversely proportional to the amount of thinking we are doing in the
moment. In other words, the less thinking we have going on, the
stronger the positive emotion we feel in the present.
To see the truth in this, recall a few other memories you had when
you were extremely stressed and anxious and see how much
thinking was going on at the time.
Take about 1-2 minutes to do this.
Then recall a few memories where you were at your happiest or
felt the most joy and love and see how much thinking you had going
on at that time.
Take another 1-2 minutes to do this before moving on to really
experience and internalize the truth of what you see.
An analogy that my coach taught me that helped crystallize this
concept was to imagine our mind has a speedometer (like in a car),
but instead of miles per hour, it is thoughts per minute. The more
thinking we have going on, the higher the ‚Äúthought-o-meter‚Äù goes,
and if we have enough thinking going on, it'll go into the red zone.
This is when we feel extremely stressed, burned out, frustrated, and
angry.
It is not the content of our thinking that causes us stress, but that
we are thinking, period. The amount of thinking we have going on is
directly correlated to the magnitude of stress and negative emotions
we are experiencing at any given moment. When you're
experiencing a lot of frustration, stress, anxiety, or any negative
emotions, just know that it is because you're thinking, and the
intensity of those emotions is directly correlated to how much
thinking is going on.
Therefore, it's not WHAT we're thinking about that is causing
us suffering, but THAT we are thinking.
To summarize, we do not have to try to "think positive" to
experience love, joy, bliss, and any positive emotions we want
because it is our natural state to feel those emotions. The only times
we don't naturally feel these emotions is when we begin to think
about the thoughts we're having, thus blocking the direct connection
to Infinite Intelligence and we feel stressed, anxious, depressed, and
fearful. It is not about the content of our thinking, but that we're
thinking, which is the root cause of our suffering. The intensity of the
negative emotions is directly correlated to the amount of thinking we
have going on in the present. The less thinking we have, the more
space we create for positive emotions to naturally surface.
CHAPTER 6
HOW THE HUMAN EXPERIENCE IS CREATED -
THE THREE PRINCIPLES
‚ÄúIf the only thing people learned was not to be afraid of their
experience, that alone would change the world.‚Äù ‚Äî Sydney Banks
At its fundamental level, the human experience is created by these
three principles: Universal Mind, Consciousness, and Thought.
These three principles work together to allow us to experience
everything we do in life and if one of the three is missing, we
wouldn't be able to experience anything. These principles were first
discovered by Sydney Banks and now I have the humbling privilege
to share them with you.
Understanding these three principles enables us to know how we
can alleviate ourselves from our suffering, but also allows us to
create from Source.
Universal Mind
Universal Mind is the Intelligence behind all living things. It is the
life force and energy that is in all things. It is how an acorn knows
how to grow into a tree, how the planets know how to stay in orbit,
and how our bodies know how to heal itself when we get a cut. It's
how our bodies know how to self-regulate and keep us alive without
us having to manually do everything like breathing and beating our
heart. The Intelligence that knows how to do all of this and is in all
things is called the Universal Mind. Many people call this God,
Infinite Intelligence, the Quantum Field, Source, and other names.
This is where Thoughts come from as well as everything else in the
Universe. All things are connected by Universal Mind. There is no
separation between anything, and any time there seems to be
separation between things, it is merely an illusion of our thinking.
When we are connected to Universal Mind, we feel whole, fulfilled,
filled with love, joy, peace, and inspiration. It is only when we begin
thinking (believing the illusion or ego) that we block this flow of
Universal Mind and begin to feel separated, frustrated, lonely, angry,
resentful, sad, depressed, and fearful.
Universal Consciousness
Universal Consciousness is the collective consciousness of all
things. It is what allows us to be aware that we exist and aware of
our thoughts. Without Universal Consciousness, we wouldn't be able
to experience anything. Our five senses would have no use because
there's nothing to be aware of. This is what brings things to life and
makes them perceivable to us.
Universal Thought
‚ÄúWe cannot change what we are not aware of, and once we are
aware, we cannot help but change.‚Äù - Sheryl Sanberg
No matter who you are, where you're from, what your background
is, what you've done and haven't done, what status or wealth you do
or don't have, Martian or not, you can find total peace, unconditional
love, complete fulfillment, and an abundance of joy in your life. I
promise that you are not the exception, even though it may seem like
it. Love knows no boundaries. An open mind and a willing heart are
all you need to receive every answer you've been looking for.
And yes, there are extremely practical implications and
byproducts of understanding what is inside of this book, which many
of my coaching clients have experienced, such as: a 2-5x increase in
income, exponential growth in their businesses, deeper and more
harmonious relationships, overcoming lifelong addictions, the
spontaneous disappearance of destructive habits, an increase in
health, vitality, and overall energy. Miracles like these occur every
day for many who understand the principles within this book. And
this is just the tip of the iceberg. If I were to just list some of the
improvements and results people have gotten from this
understanding, more than half of this book would just be stories of
such miracles that happen daily.
I am reluctant to mention any of these "external" results because
it is not the point of this book. These physical manifestations are the
byproduct of this inside-out understanding of how our experiences of
life work. In actuality, we only want these external results like money
and significance because we want to experience certain feelings
inside such as love, joy, peace, and fulfillment. The feeling is really
what we want in our lives, not the physical things, but the trap is that
we believe the physical things will give us those feelings. The secret
lies within the feeling.
This book will help guide you to understand how to uncover the
truth you already know inside and discover these feelings you've
been looking for your entire life.
Now let's get into the guide of how to go through this book.
Don‚Äôt read this book for information, read it for insight. Insight (or
wisdom) can only be found within. That is why it is called insight (in-
side). To find everything you're looking for in life, you must look
inside yourself and discover the wisdom that already exists within
you. All the answers lie deep within your soul. This book is merely a
guide to help you look in the right place. I truly admire anyone who
still has the hope that what they're looking for is still out there. This
means you have hope. Without hope, we have nothing, so the fact
that you're here, reading this now, is a testament to your faith,
courage, and strength. I know with one hundred percent certainty
that you will find what you're looking for if you continue down the
path you're on with the hope you have in your heart.
I want to make it clear that this book is not the only book that
contains truth. The truth lies within everyone and in everything. You
must look beyond the form (the physical) to see and experience the
truth (the spiritual). The words in this book are not truth. They point
TO the truth. Look beyond words to see the truth for yourself. Truth
cannot be intellectualized; it can only be experienced. The truth lies
within a feeling, which is why it cannot be formulated into a word.
If you want to find truth, look beyond the words, and look for a
feeling.
Many who discover the truth will describe the feeling as one of
complete peace, unconditional love, and an overwhelming amount of
joy. People also describe it as the most familiar unfamiliar feeling. It
feels like you're finally home. Look for that feeling, and everything
will be revealed to you. In this book, I will not say anything that you
don't already know deep inside your soul. This is why it will be a
familiar unfamiliar feeling when you experience the truth.
Don‚Äôt try to use your intellect to figure it out ‚Äî you won‚Äôt. As soon
as you intellectualize it, you've missed it. The truth does not come
from memorizing a sentence or two. A child can do that, but they will
not understand the truth. The truth comes in the form of a feeling.
From that feeling will come the wisdom and truth you‚Äôre looking for,
which will set you free. That's what we're all ultimately seeking, isn't
it?
What I will unveil to you in this book will seem simple. It will seem
almost too simple, and your brain (ego) will try to fight it or attempt to
make it more complex. It will think that it can‚Äôt be this simple. When
that time comes, I want you to remember that the truth is always
simple. What is complex can always be broken down into its smaller
counterparts. The truth cannot be broken down into smaller
constituents, which is what makes it truth. This is why truth is always
simple. If you want to find the truth, look for simplicity.
Approach this book with an open mind and a heart of pure
intention to know the truth and you'll receive everything you've been
searching for.
Before we move on, I want to take a moment to express my
deepest gratitude for you being here and sharing your time and
attention with me. Those are some of the most valuable life forces
you could give to another, so thank you for that gift to me, which you
are also giving to yourself. Never forget your own divinity because it
is only through our divinity that we have our humanity.
With Love & Light,
Joseph
CHAPTER 1
THE JOURNEY TO FINDING THE ROOT CAUSE
OF SUFFERING
"People have a hard time letting go of their suffering. Out of a fear of
the unknown, they prefer suffering that is familiar.‚Äù ‚Äï Thich Nhat
Hanh
There is an important distinction to make when speaking about
suffering. When I mention suffering in this book, I'm referring to
psychological and emotional suffering. There is a way in which, no
matter what happens in your life, you do not have to suffer
emotionally and psychologically.
I am not saying that what we go through is all in our heads or
made up. Terrible and unfortunate events happen to people every
single day. What I'm saying is that although we experience a lot of
pain in our lives, suffering is optional. In other words, pain is
unavoidable, but how we react to the events and circumstances that
happen in our lives is up to us, and that will dictate whether we suffer
or not.
Buddhists say that anytime we experience a negative event in our
lives, two arrows fly our way. Being physically struck by an arrow is
painful. Being struck by a second emotional arrow is even more
painful (suffering).
The Buddha explained, ‚ÄúIn life, we can‚Äôt always control the first
arrow. However, the second arrow is our reaction to the first. The
second arrow is optional.‚Äù
When I first heard of this quote from Buddha a few years back, I
was confounded because although I understood what he meant, I
didn't know how I could apply this in my own life. If anyone were
given the clear choice of suffering and not suffering, I don't think
anyone in their right mind would choose to suffer.
How can I just choose not to suffer? If it were as easy as that I
don't think anyone would be suffering anymore. It wasn't until years
later that I came across a new understanding of where suffering
comes from that I was able to stop it at its source.
As I began my journey of self-improvement, I came across a
myriad of different teachings, studies, and methods to help people
overcome their problems. I read dozens, if not hundreds of books,
studied psychology, went to therapists, listened to many different
thought leaders, tried changing my habits, waking up at 4am,
changing my diet, becoming more structured and disciplined,
shadow work, studying personality types, meditating daily, going on
spiritual retreats, following spiritual masters, and researching
different ancient religions.
If you name it, I've probably tried it. I was desperate to find an
answer because I wanted to know how to stop suffering in my own
life as well as help others do the same. Although some of these
things did help me improve incrementally, it didn‚Äôt stop my suffering. I
still always felt extremely anxious, fearful, unfulfilled, irritated, angry,
frustrated, and heavy every day. Even after doing all of that, I still
didn't discover the answer and, if I'm being honest, I was even more
lost than before I started on this quest.
I felt purposeless, hopeless, and directionless. I didn't know what
to do anymore, where to look, or who to talk to. It wasn't until I was in
my darkest hour that a glimmer of hope began to lead me to the
light.
All of the sudden, after years and years of searching, I stumbled
upon one of my first mentors that taught me how to become a coach
and he revealed to me the answer of how I can alleviate my own
suffering.
The answer I discovered was in the understanding of how our
minds work and how the human experience is created.
CHAPTER 2
THE ROOT CAUSE OF ALL SUFFERING
‚ÄúOne who looks around him is intelligent, one who looks within him is
wise.‚Äù ‚Äï Matshona Dhliwayo
We live in a world of thought, not reality. Sydney Banks once said,
‚ÄúThought is not reality; yet it is through thought that our realities are
created.‚Äù Each of us lives through our own perceptions of the world,
which are vastly different from the person right next to us. An
example of this is that you could be sitting in a coffee shop having a
quarter-life existential crisis, completely stressed out of your mind
about how you have no idea what you‚Äôre doing with your life when it
seems like everyone else has theirs together, while the person next
to you is happily enjoying their freshly brewed drink while peacefully
people watching. You both are in the same exact coffee shop,
smelling the same aroma, surrounded by the same strangers, but
how the world looks to both of you couldn't be more different. Many
of us go through the exact same events or are in the same location
at the same time yet are having completely different experiences of
the world.
Here's another example of how we live in a world of thought and
not reality. If you walk up to 100 different people and ask each of
them what money means to them, how many different answers do
you think you'll get? Close to 100 different answers!
Money is technically the same thing, but it means something
different to each person. Money could mean time, freedom,
opportunity, security, peace of mind, or it could mean evil, greed, and
the reason why people commit crimes. For now, I'm not going to get
into which one is right or wrong (hint: there is no right or wrong
answer, but that's for a different chapter).
Another illustration of this concept is as follows: If you survey 100
different people and ask each of them what they think of our current
president, how many different answers do you think you'll get?
Even though it is the same exact person we're talking about, we
will get 100 different answers because most people live in their own
thoughts and perceptions of the world. The meaning (or thinking) we
give an event is what determines how we ultimately feel about it.
That meaning or thinking is the filter through which we see life from
then on ‚Äî because of this, we live through a perception of reality,
not in reality itself. Reality is that the event happened, with no
meaning, thinking, or interpretation of it.
Any meaning or thinking we give the event is on us and that is
how our perception of reality is created. This is how our experience
of life is created from the inside out.
It's not about the events that happen in our lives, but our
interpretation of them, which causes us to feel good or bad about
something. This is how people in third world countries can be
happier than people in first world countries and people in first world
countries can be more miserable than people in third world
countries.
Our feelings do not come from external events, but from our
own thinking about the events. Therefore, we can only ever feel
what we are thinking.
Let's hypothetically say that you really hate your job, and it causes
you an enormous amount of stress, anxiety, and frustration. It pains
you to even set foot in the building where you work and just thinking
about your job makes you furious. When you're thinking about your
job, you're just sitting there on a sofa with your family watching a TV
show together, but you are fuming at the thought of your job.
Everyone else is having a good time, except you.
In this moment, everyone else in your family is having a different
experience of life than you, even though the same event is
happening. Just the thought of work created a whole different
perception of reality, even though you're not physically at work.
If it were true that external events cause us to feel the way we feel
inside, then you should be a happy camper in your living room,
watching a funny TV show with your family every single time you do
this activity ‚Äî but that's not the case.
Now, you may be saying that you're only feeling this way because
an external event, your job, is causing you to feel stressed and
anxious. To that I'll ask the question, is it absolutely true that every
single person feels the exact same way about the job they're working
in?
Two different people can be doing the exact same job but will
have completely different experiences of that job. It can be the most
amazing experience and a dream job for one person but be another
person's worst nightmare and living hell. The only difference
between one person and the other is how they think about their job,
which determines how they ultimately feel about it.
Now let's go back to the original scenario of you hypothetically
hating your job. Remember how much stress, anxiety, and frustration
it causes you when you think about it?
Let's do a quick thought experiment about that by answering the
question below:
Who would you be without that thought that you hated your
job?
Take 1 minute to see what comes up for you and don't move on
until you do that.
If you don't overthink it and truly let the answers surface from
within you, without that thought, you will most likely feel and be
happy, peaceful, free, and light.
Without our usual thinking about a particular event or thing, our
experience of it completely alters. This is how we live in a world of
thought, not reality, and how our perception of reality is created from
the inside out, through our own thinking. With this new
understanding, you've just uncovered the cause of all our human
psychological suffering...
The root cause of our suffering is our own thinking.
Now before you throw this book across the room and light it on
fire, I'm not saying that this is all in our heads and that it isn't real.
Our perception of reality is very real. We will feel what we think, and
our feelings are real. That is completely undeniable. However, our
thinking will look like an inevitable, unchangeable reality to us until
we begin seeing how our reality is created. If we know that we can
only ever feel what we are thinking, then we know that we can
change our feelings by changing our thinking. Thus, we can change
our experience of life by knowing that it comes from our own
thinking. And if that is true, then we are ever only one thought away
from experiencing something different and transforming our entire
lives at any moment ‚Äî through a state of no thought.
In short, the moment we stop thinking is when our happiness
begins.
A Young Monk & the Empty Boat (A Zen Story About How
Thinking is the Cause of Our Own Suffering)
A long time ago, a young Zen monk was living in a small
monastery that was located in a forest which was near a small lake.
The monastery was occupied by a few senior monks while the rest
were newcomers and still had much to learn. The monks had many
obligations in the monastery, but one of the most important ones was
their daily routine where they had to sit down, close their eyes, and
meditate in silence for hours at a time.
After each meditation, they had to report their progress to their
mentor. The young monk had difficulty staying focused during his
meditation practice for a variety of reasons, which made him very
mad. After the young monk reported his progress, or better said, lack
of it, to his mentor, the elder monk asked the young monk a simple
question that had a hidden lesson, ‚ÄúDo you know what is really
making you angry?‚Äù The young monk replied, ‚ÄúWell, usually as soon
as I close my eyes and begin to meditate, there is someone moving
around, and I can‚Äôt focus. I get agitated that someone is disturbing
me even though they know that I‚Äôm meditating. How can they not be
more considerate? And then when I close my eyes again and try to
focus, a cat or a small animal might brush past and disturb me again.
By this point, even when the wind blows and the tree branches make
noise, I get angry. If that is not enough, the birds keep on chirping,
and I can‚Äôt seem to find any peace in this place.‚Äù
The elder monk simply pointed out to his pupil, ‚ÄúI see that you
become angrier with each interruption you encounter. This is exactly
the opposite of what is the point of your task when meditating. You
should find a way not to get angry with people, or animals, or any
other thing around you that disturbs you during your task.‚Äù After their
consultation, the young monk went out of the monastery and looked
around to find a place that would be quieter so that he could
meditate peacefully. He found such a place at the shore of the lake
that is nearby. He brought his mat, sat down, and started meditating.
But soon a flock of birds splashed down in the lake near where the
monk was meditating. Hearing their noise, the monk opened his
eyes to see what was going on.
Although the bank of the lake was quieter than the monastery,
there were still things that would disturb his peace and he again got
angry. Even though he didn‚Äôt find the peace he was looking for, he
kept returning to the lake. Then one day, the monk saw a boat tied at
the end of a small pier. And right then an idea hit him, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt I
take the boat, row it down to the middle of the lake and meditate
there? In the middle of the lake, there will be nothing to disturb me!‚Äù
He rowed the boat to the middle of the lake and started meditating.
As he had expected, there was nothing in the middle of the lake to
disturb him and he was able to meditate the whole day. At the end of
the day, he returned to the monastery. This continued for a couple of
days and the monk was thrilled that he had finally found a place to
meditate in peace. He hadn‚Äôt felt angry and could continue the
meditation practice in a calm manner.
On the third day, the monk sat in the boat, rowed to the middle of
the lake, and started meditating again. A few minutes later, he heard
some splashing of water and felt that the boat was rocking. He
started getting upset that even in the middle of the lake there was
someone or something disturbing him.
When he opened his eyes, he saw a boat heading straight
towards him. He shouted, ‚ÄúSteer your boat away, or else you will hit
my boat.‚Äù But the other boat kept coming straight at him and was just
a few feet away. He yelled again but nothing changed and so the
incoming boat hit the monk‚Äôs boat. Now he was furious. He
screamed, ‚ÄúWho are you, and why have you hit my boat in the
middle of this vast lake?‚Äù There was no answer. This made the
young monk even angrier.
He stood up to see who was in the other boat and to his surprise,
he found that there was no one in the boat.
The boat had probably drifted along in the breeze and had
bumped into the monk‚Äôs le, or animals, or any
other thing around you that disturbs you during your task.‚Äù After their
consultation, the young monk went out of the monastery and looked
around to find a place that would be quieter so that he could
meditate peacefully. He found such a place at the shore of the lake
that is nearby. He brought his mat, sat down, and started meditating.
But soon a flock of birds splashed down in the lake near where the
monk was meditating. Hearing their noise, the monk opened his
eyes to see what was going on.
Although the bank of the lake was quieter than the monastery,
there were still things that would disturb his peace and he again got
angry. Even though he didn‚Äôt find the peace he was looking for, he
kept returning to the lake. Then one day, the monk saw a boat tied at
the end of a small pier. And right then an idea hit him, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt I
take the boat, row it down to the middle of the lake and meditate
there? In the middle of the lake, there will be nothing to disturb me!‚Äù
He rowed the boat to the middle of the lake and started meditating.
As he had expected, there was nothing in the middle of the lake to
disturb him and he was able to meditate the whole day. At the end of
the day, he returned to the monastery. This continued for a couple of
days and the monk was thrilled that he had finally found a place to
meditate in peace. He hadn‚Äôt felt angry and could continue the
meditationjob is to alert us of potential dangers in our
environment that may threaten our lives. It does its job so well that
not only will it scan our immediate surroundings for threats, but it will
even reference our backlog of past experiences to create
hypothetical scenarios and predict what it thinks could be future
potential dangers based on our memories.
None of this is wrong by any means. The mind is simply doing
what it was designed to do. When we don‚Äôt understand that its only
duty is to help us survive, then we will get angry and frustrated with
it. All conflict is derived from an innocent misunderstanding. Our
mind‚Äôs duty is to keep us alive. Our consciousness‚Äôs duty is to help
us feel fulfilled. Your soul is the reason why you‚Äôre even on this
journey in the first place ‚Äî to find peace, love, and joy for yourself.
Your mind has done an amazing job at what it was made to do,
but now you may relieve it of its job because we no longer live in the
wild where death could be right around the corner in a bush. If we
keep using our minds, we will constantly stay in a state of fight or
flight, anxiety, fear, frustration, depression, anger, resentment, and
all negative emotions because the mind thinks everything is a threat
to our very existence. If you want to be free, happy, peaceful, and full
of love, then you will need to let go of listening only to your mind and
go beyond it by tuning into something much greater that will help you
not just to survive, but to thrive.
CHAPTER 4
THOUGHTS VS. THINKING
‚ÄúStop thinking and end your problems.‚Äù ‚Äï Lao Tzu
Thoughts are the energetic, mental raw materials from which we use
to create everything in the world. We can‚Äôt experience anything
without thought. It‚Äôs important to know that thoughts are a noun and
aren‚Äôt something that we do, but something we have. A thought
takes no effort or force on our end, and it is something that just
happens. We also cannot control what thoughts pop into our minds.
The source of thoughts comes from something that is beyond our
minds ‚Äî the Universe, if you will.
Thinking, on the other hand, is the act of thinking about our
thoughts. This takes a significant amount of energy, effort, and
willpower (which is a finite resource). Thinking is actively engaging
with the thoughts in your mind. You don‚Äôt have to engage with each
thought in your mind, but when you do, that is thinking.
Thinking is the root cause of all our psychological suffering.
Now you might be wondering, where do positive thoughts fit into
the picture? Positive thoughts, or thoughts that feel good, are not a
result of thinking. They are, instead, generated by our natural state
of peace, love, and joy. They are a byproduct of a state of being, not
a state of thinking. We will go into depth about this in the next
chapter.
For now, let‚Äôs do a quick thought experiment.
I‚Äôll ask you a question and all you need to do is to be aware of
what you‚Äôre experiencing, and we‚Äôll review what happened after.
What is the dream amount of money you want to be making a
year?
Pause here and wait for an answer to surface.
Give yourself about 30-60 seconds to think about your answer of
how much money you want to be making in a year.
Don‚Äôt move on to the next step until you‚Äôve had a decently sized
train of thought about how much you want to make.
Now take that amount and multiply that by 5.
What do you think about this new dream goal for your income
when we multiplied it by 5?
Take at least another 30-60 seconds to become aware of how
you‚Äôre feeling when you think about that and see what other thinking
comes up for you as you feel your emotions.
Don‚Äôt move on until you‚Äôve done the above.
Okay, let‚Äôs bring it back in and review what happened.
After I asked the first question of what is the dream amount of
money you want to be making per year, within a few seconds an
answer popped up in your mind. That is a thought. Notice how
quickly and effortlessly that came to you.
After an answer popped into your mind, I asked you to think about
your answer. What happened once I asked you to think about your
answer?
If you‚Äôre like most people, you probably went on a wild
rollercoaster once you began thinking about the thought.
You might have been thinking how there‚Äôs no way you can make
that much, no one in your family is making that much money, you
don‚Äôt know how to make that much, it‚Äôs stupid to want that much
money or that it makes you greedy.
Notice how you felt when you were thinking about those thoughts.
Most likely it didn‚Äôt feel that great, but that is okay, and I‚Äôll show
you what you can do about it soon.
This is a prime example of thoughts versus thinking.
If I ask you a question, you will 100% have a thought that pops
into your mind.
Thoughts are not inherently bad. Remember that they are the
energetic mental raw materials from which we create in the world.
The moment we think about our thoughts is when we begin to get
taken on an emotional rollercoaster. When we think about our
thoughts, we begin to judge and criticize the thoughts and
experience all sorts of internal emotional turmoil.
When I asked you how much you wanted to make, you had a
thought about the amount. That thought was neutral and didn‚Äôt cause
any emotional toil. In fact, you might have felt expansive and excited.
It was only when you began thinking about that thought of how much
you wanted to make which is what caused the self-doubt,
unworthiness, anxiety, anger, guilt, or any other emotion you may
have experienced.
This is what I mean by thinking is the root of all of our suffering.
Having the initial thought of how much you wanted to make didn‚Äôt
cause any suffering until you began thinking about the thought of
how much you wanted to make.
It is not necessary to think about our thoughts or to judge them. It
does us no good to do so. We may think that thinking is helping us,
but all it‚Äôs really doing is causing us to feel all of these negative,
unwanted emotions and making us create reasons as to why we
can‚Äôt do it or why we shouldn‚Äôt want it.
The only thing that was useful and helpful was the initial thought
that popped into your mind when I first asked how much you wanted
to make. All of the thinking that happened after was destructive and
unhelpful.
Thoughts create. Thinking destroys.
The reason thinking destroys is because as soon as we begin to
think about the thoughts, we cast our own limiting beliefs,
judgements, criticisms, programming, and conditioning onto the
thought, thinking of infinite reasons as to why we can‚Äôt do it and why
we can‚Äôt have it.
Without thinking, we prevent all negative programming and
judgements from tarnishing the initial thought of what you want to
create.
If I asked you what are some ways you could make the amount of
money you want, if you sat there long enough, you‚Äôll experience the
same phenomenon of having random thoughts pop into your head of
ways you could make it happen.
These are thoughts of creation. Thoughts are inherently infinite,
expansive, and energetically positive. You‚Äôll know you are having
thoughts from the divine when you feel positive emotions, feel lighter,
and alive.
As soon as you begin thinking about those thoughts of the ways
you can make the money you want, you‚Äôll immediately feel heavy,
restricted, limited, along with a whole onslaught of negative
emotions. This is how you‚Äôll know if you‚Äôre thinking.
I use my feelings as an internal radar that tells me whether I‚Äôm
getting direct downloads of thoughts from the Universe or if I‚Äôm in my
head thinking about my thoughts.
You can only ever feel what you‚Äôre thinking, so feelings and
emotions are like an intuitive internal dashboard which tells me if I‚Äôm
thinking too much or not.
If I‚Äôm having a lot of negative emotions, I know that I‚Äôm thinking
too much. This is another example of how we‚Äôre naturally built for
success.
Below is a chart that compares Thinking vs. Thoughts to help you
identify which one is which within your mind:

CHAPTER 5
IF WE CAN ONLY FEEL WHAT WE'RE THINKING,
DON'T WE NEED TO THINK POSITIVELY TO FEEL
THAT WAY?
‚ÄúWe are ever only one thought away from peace, love, and joy ‚Äî
which come from a state of no thought.‚Äù ‚Äî Dicken Bettinger
There is a caveat that I haven't mentioned yet to the principle that we
can only feel what we're thinking. The more accurate way of
describing it is that we can only ever feel negative emotions when
we are thinking.
The goal isn't necessarily to completely stop feeling negative
emotions. Some of the negative emotions can be helpful, such as
feeling fearful when deciding to walk down a dark alley alone with no
one else in sight.
These negative emotions are only helpful to us in terms of
survival, but if we don't constantly encounter life or death situations,
negative emotions are more unhelpful than helpful for most of us.
We're going to be moving forward with the context that we're not
struggling for physical survival, so we'll be using the context that
negative emotions are not necessary most of the time.
When I mention that we can only ever feel what we're thinking,
most people assume that we must think positive to feel positive
emotions.
Instead of convincing you if this is true or not, let's do another
thought experiment so you can experience the truth for yourself.
Recall a time when you felt the most joy and love you've ever felt
in your life and feel the feelings that you felt at that time as much as
you can for at least 30 seconds.
What kinds of thoughts were going through your mind at that peak
moment when you felt the most joy and love? (I'm not asking what
you were doing at the time, but what thoughts were going through
your head at that exact moment.)
For many people that answer this, they realize that they didn't
have any thoughts during that exact moment. For others, they say
that the thought was that they were so grateful or happy.
For those that answered that they had the thought that they were
grateful, did you feel that joy and love before you had that thought or
after?
Take 10-15 seconds to answer that question before moving on.
What insights and epiphanies did you have?
What's crazy is that most people didn't have any thoughts going
through their mind when they felt the happiest and the most amount
of love in their lives. For those that had the thought that they were
grateful, they felt that way before having that thought.
If they had that thought, it happened after they felt the feelings, so
the thought could not have produced the feeling.
This brings us to another truth: you do not have to have
thoughts or think to feel positive emotions.
The beautiful part about truth is that it needs no justification
because it can be experienced right here right now. It doesn't need
to be proven or rationalized to you and you experienced this truth
firsthand by the experiment we just did.
Here's why we don't need to have thoughts or think to feel positive
emotions like joy and love.
Our natural state of being IS joy, love, ecstasy, freedom, and
gratitude. This may be hard to believe because if it's natural, why
don't we feel that way all the time? I'll answer this in a bit.
If we want to see the natural state of anything, one of the best
ways is to look at nature and the state of it in its infancy (before it is
affected and conditioned by its environment).
For example, let's look at the natural state of a baby. What is a
baby's natural and default state (assuming the baby wasn't abused,
neglected, or had any physical issues)? Are babies naturally
stressed, anxious, fearful, and self-conscious? Or are they naturally
in a state of bliss, happiness, and love?
Our natural state of being is joy, love, and peace. Therefore, any
thinking that we do will only take us away from those natural states
of being, which is why whenever we feel extremely stressed, we are
having a LOT of thinking going on. The strength of the negative
emotion we feel is in direct proportion to how much thinking we are
doing in the moment.
On the other hand, the intensity of the positive emotion we feel is
inversely proportional to the amount of thinking we are doing in the
moment. In other words, the less thinking we have going on, the
stronger the positive emotion we feel in the present.
To see the truth in this, recall a few other memories you had when
you were extremely stressed and anxious and see how much
thinking was going on at the time.
Take about 1-2 minutes to do this.
Then recall a few memories where you were at your happiest or
felt the most joy and love and see how much thinking you had going
on at that time.
Take another 1-2 minutes to do this before moving on to really
experience and internalize the truth of what you see.
An analogy that my coach taught me that helped crystallize this
concept was to imagine our mind has a speedometer (like in a car),
but instead of miles per hour, it is thoughts per minute. The more
thinking we have going on, the higher the ‚Äúthought-o-meter‚Äù goes,
and if we have enough thinking going on, it'll go into the red zone.
This is when we feel extremely stressed, burned out, frustrated, and
angry.
It is not the content of our thinking that causes us stress, but that
we are thinking, period. The amount of thinking we have going on is
directly correlated to the magnitude of stress and negative emotions
we are experiencing at any given moment. When you're
experiencing a lot of frustration, stress, anxiety, or any negative
emotions, just know that it is because you're thinking, and the
intensity of those emotions is directly correlated to how much
thinking is going on.
Therefore, it's not WHAT we're thinking about that is causing
us suffering, but THAT we are thinking.
To summarize, we do not have to try to "think positive" to
experience love, joy, bliss, and any positive emotions we want
because it is our natural state to feel those emotions. The only times
we don't naturally feel these emotions is when we begin to think
about the thoughts we're having, thus blocking the direct connection
to Infinite Intelligence and we feel stressed, anxious, depressed, and
fearful. It is not about the content of our thinking, but that we're
thinking, which is the root cause of our suffering. The intensity of the
negative emotions is directly correlated to the amount of thinking we
have going on in the present. The less thinking we have, the more
space we create for positive emotions to naturally surface.
CHAPTER 6
HOW THE HUMAN EXPERIENCE IS CREATED -
THE THREE PRINCIPLES
‚ÄúIf the only thing people learned was not to be afraid of their
experience, that alone would change the world.‚Äù ‚Äî Sydney Banks
At its fundamental level, the human experience is created by these
three principles: Universal Mind, Consciousness, and Thought.
These three principles work together to allow us to experience
everything we do in life and if one of the three is missing, we
wouldn't be able to experience anything. These principles were first
discovered by Sydney Banks and now I have the humbling privilege
to share them with you.
Understanding these three principles enables us to know how we
can alleviate ourselves from our suffering, but also allows us to
create from Source.
Universal Mind
Universal Mind is the Intelligence behind all living things. It is the
life force and energy that is in all things. It is how an acorn knows
how to grow into a tree, how the planets know how to stay in orbit,
and how our bodies know how to heal itself when we get a cut. It's
how our bodies know how to self-regulate and keep us alive without
us having to manually do everything like breathing and beating our
heart. The Intelligence that knows how to do all of this and is in all
things is called the Universal Mind. Many people call this God,
Infinite Intelligence, the Quantum Field, Source, and other names.
This is where Thoughts come from as well as everything else in the
Universe. All things are connected by Universal Mind. There is no
separation between anything, and any time there seems to be
separation between things, it is merely an illusion of our thinking.
When we are connected to Universal Mind, we feel whole, fulfilled,
filled with love, joy, peace, and inspiration. It is only when we begin
thinking (believing the illusion or ego) that we block this flow of
Universal Mind and begin to feel separated, frustrated, lonely, angry,
resentful, sad, depressed, and fearful.
Universal Consciousness
Universal Consciousness is the collective consciousness of all
things. It is what allows us to be aware that we exist and aware of
our thoughts. Without Universal Consciousness, we wouldn't be able
to experience anything. Our five senses would have no use because
there's nothing to be aware of. This is what brings things to life and
makes them perceivable to us.
Universal Thought
Universal Thought is the raw material of the Universe from which
we can create from. It is our ability to think and create form from the
energy of the Universal Mind.
It's the object we can perceive through Consciousness. Without
Thought, we would have nothing to be aware of. Thought is like the
DVD that contains all the information for us to be able to watch the
movie on the TV. The TV and DVD player is like Consciousness ‚Äî it
allows us to have a mechanism to bring the information on the DVD
to life for us to be able to watch and experience the movie. The
electricity that's needed to power the DVD player and TV is like
Universal Mind in the sense that it is the invisible energy/force that
connects and powers all things. It is the Source from which
everything can work and function.
CHAPTER 7
IF THINKING IS THE ROOT CAUSE OF OUR
SUFFERING, HOW DO WE STOP THINKING?
‚ÄúA crowded mind leaves no space for a peaceful heart.‚Äù ‚Äî Christine
Evangelou
Heaven and Hell: A Zen Parable
A tough, brawny samurai once approached a Zen master who was
deep in meditation. Impatient and discourteous, the samurai
demanded in his husky voice so accustomed to forceful yelling, ‚ÄúTell
me the nature of heaven and hell.‚Äù
The Zen master opened his eyes, looked the samurai in the face,
and replied with a certain scorn, ‚ÄúWhy should I answer to a shabby,
disgusting, despondent slob like you? A worm like you, do you think I
should tell you anything? I can‚Äôt stand you. Get out of my sight. I
have no time for silly questions.‚Äù
The samurai could not bear these insults. Consumed by rage, he
drew his sword and raised it to sever the master‚Äôs head at once.
Looking straight into the samurai‚Äôs eyes, the Zen master tenderly
declared, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs hell.‚Äù
The samurai froze. He immediately understood that anger had
him in its grip. His mind had just created his own hell ‚Äî one filled
with resentment, hatred, self-defense, and fury. He realized that he
was so deep in his torment that he was ready to kill somebody.
The samurai‚Äôs eyes filled with tears. Setting his sword aside, he
put his palms together and obsequiously bowed in gratitude for this
insight.
The Zen master gently acknowledged with a delicate smile, ‚ÄúAnd
that‚Äôs heaven.‚Äù
It's not possible to just entirely stop thinking, but what we can do
is reduce the time we spend thinking so that it gets smaller and
smaller each day that passes. Eventually we can get to the point
where we spend most of our day not caught up in our thinking and
live in a blissful state most of the time.
When we say that we want to stop thinking, many people assume
that we are trying to stop all thoughts in general. This isn't what we're
trying to do. Now that you know the difference between thoughts and
thinking, we are working on allowing thoughts to come and flow
through us while we minimize the thinking about those thoughts that
emerge.
The most interesting and almost paradoxical thing about stopping
our thinking is that we don't have to do anything to minimize it other
than to be aware of it. By us becoming aware that we are thinking
and that it is the root cause of all our suffering, it automatically
makes us conscious to that fact and we become detached to it,
allowing it to settle and pass. This takes almost no effort and is done
through pure presence in the moment.
Here‚Äôs an analogy from one of my mentors that illustrates this
concept:
Imagine I give you a bowl of cloudy, dirty, murky water. If I asked
you, how you would make the water clear, how would you do it?
Take 15 seconds to see what answers you come up with before
moving on.
Most people say something along the lines of filtering the water or
even boiling it. What most people don't realize is that if we let the
bowl of dirty water sit for a period of time, we can see that the dirt
begins to settle on its own in the water and after a while, the water
becomes clear on its own.
This is how our minds also work. If we let our thinking sit without
disturbing it by trying to "filter" or "boil" it, the thinking will settle down
on its own and our minds will become free from thinking. The natural
state of water is clear, and the natural state of our minds is also
clear, if we do not disturb it.
If life begins to feel unclear, disorganized, stressful and you're not
sure what to do next, you now know that it's only because your
thinking is stirring up the dirt, making your mind cloudy and difficult to
see ahead. You can use this as an indicator to help you realize that
you're thinking way too much.
Once we become aware of the fact that we are only feeling what
we're thinking and that thinking is the root cause of our unpleasant
experience, we see it for what it truly is. Then we allow it to settle by
giving it space, and slowly we will see how we begin to have a clear
mind again.
You can also compare thinking to quicksand. The more that we
fight our thinking, the more it amplifies the negative emotions and the
worse it gets. The same is true for quicksand. If we‚Äôre in quicksand,
the way out isn‚Äôt to fight it. If we panic and frantically try to fight it, it
only makes things worse by tightening the grip it has on us and
pulling us under faster. The only way out is to stop struggling and
allowing the natural buoyancy of your body to take over to bring you
back up to the surface with ease. The only way to break free from
our thinking is to let go and trust that our natural inner wisdom will
guide us back to clarity and peace like it always has.
If you find yourself fluctuating between thinking and non-thinking,
know that it is completely okay and quite normal. There is no way
that we can remain in a state of non-thinking every second of every
day and if we try to make that a goal, we will cause ourselves to
suffer by forcing ourselves back into thinking again.
We are spiritual, infinite beings having a physical, finite
experience. Because of this, we are literally a living gateway
between the human and the divine, so we will naturally oscillate
between the two states of feeling anxious/stressed and
joyful/peaceful. We cannot control or prevent the oscillation between
thinking and non-thinking, but we can minimize the time spent in
thinking and thus creating more moments where we do feel joyful,
peaceful, passionate, and full of love.
Although not being able to control when we begin to think can
seem like we are cursed with an inevitable fate, it is not something to
worry about because we can always return to the state of non-
thinking. It is just a part of our beautiful human experience.
What can give us true peace is knowing that we always have this
state of pure peace, love, and fulfillment underneath any thinking
that we may ever have at any given moment. That beautiful state we
always want is something we can never lose, but only forget. But just
because we can forget it doesn't mean it's not there. Just like when it
becomes night and the sun sets, we know that the sun is always
there, we just can't see it. If we thought when the sun sets that it may
never come back, then understandably we will have a lot of anxious
and fearful thoughts. The same is true for our state of being.
We are ever really one moment away from remembering that
we always have that infinite well of clarity, love, joy, peace, and
fulfillment. We will forget sometimes, but when we do remember
and realize that we are caught up in our thinking when we
experience negative emotions, that alone will allow us to return back
home to our natural beautiful state. All we have to do is remember it,
know that this is just our thinking, and have peace knowing that the
sun is not gone forever and that it will rise again soon enough.
Having that understanding will allow us to also appreciate the
nighttime for its existence and role in the Universe. From that we can
see how it is meant to be a part of our human experience and begin
to cherish its beauty as much as the sun.
CHAPTER 8
HOW CAN WE POSSIBLY THRIVE IN THE WORLD
WITHOUT THINKING?
‚ÄúAnxiety is thought without control. Flow is control without thought.‚Äù
‚Äî James Clear
Here‚Äôs a question that will guide you to an insight about this
question:
What thoughts are going through your head when you're doing
your absolute best work where you're fully captivated and entranced
by what you're doing in the moment?
Take about 15 seconds to wait for an answer to pop up before
moving on.
If you still haven't had the insight or epiphany from the answer,
here's another question that may point you in the right direction:
When you are loving what you do so much and are completely
engrossed in it that you lose all sense of time and space (aka when
you're in a state of complete flow), what thoughts are going through
your mind as you're in the state of flow in the moment?
Pause here and wait for the answer to arise (give it about 30-60
seconds for the insight to come in).
When you are doing your best work and are in a total state of flow,
where there is no separation between you or the work you are doing,
you are having no thoughts in the moment. And if you are having
thoughts, it's just flowing right through you without you having to
think about it. In other words, the state of peak performance for
humans can be described as the state of non-thinking. It may seem
crazy, but we do our best work when we aren't thinking, and you just
proved it with your own experience.
Here's another example that will help illuminate the truth of this
topic. When professional or even Olympic athletes are competing, do
you think they are thinking and overanalyzing every single thing
that's happening during the game? What thoughts or thinking do you
think is going on during the competition for them? The highest
performing athletes will describe when they are in their peak state
that they are in "the zone". This "zone" is the state of flow or the
state of non-thinking.
In Japanese culture, they have a beautiful word to describe this
phenomenon: mushin.
Here is the definition from Shotokantimes:
‚ÄúMushin is achieved when [the] mind is free of random thoughts,
free of anger, free of fear, and particularly free of ego. It applies
during combat, and or other facets of life. When mushin is achieved
during combat there is an absence of loose or rambling thoughts. It
leaves the practitioner free to act and react without hesitation. He
reacts according to all of the study and training that has brought the
karateka to this point. Relying on, not what you think should be your
next move, but on what your trained, instinctive, subconscious
reaction directs you to do.‚Äù
After practice, thinking hinders the performance of athletes and
the same is true for everyone. We only hesitate, are reluctant, have
doubts, insecurities, and fears only when we begin thinking and
over-analyzing. We function and perform our best and embody our
full potential the moment we enter a state of non-thinking. Without
thinking, we are free from limitations of the ego and are able to
create the most incredible things in the world. I am not asking you to
adopt this belief, but to try it and experience it for yourself so that you
gain the insight to make it your own.
CHAPTER 9
IF WE STOP THINKING, WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT
OUR GOALS, DREAMS & AMBITIONS?
‚ÄúThere are no limitations to the mind except those we acknowledge.‚Äù
‚Äî Napoleon Hill
I think, therefore I suffer.
When I finally understood that thinking was the root cause of all of
my suffering, I was jumping up and down, exhilarated, relieved and
grateful for discovering the true reason for everything negative I've
experienced in my life. This ecstasy was short-lived though because
soon after the exuberance settled, the next thoughts popped into my
mind:
If thinking is the root cause of all my suffering and I just stop
thinking, how do I live my life now? What about all of my goals,
dreams, and ambitions? Do I stop wanting things in life? Will I just
devolve into a couch potato and not do anything with my life
anymore?
In case you were wondering, yes, I am telepathic and yes, I can
read your mind. Just kidding, but if you are wondering how I wrote
the exact or very similar questions and know what thoughts you most
likely have right now, it's because I am human also, contrary to
popular belief. All of us are going through similar journeys of
awakening to our True Selves, so rest assured that many people are
having the exact same thoughts you are having right now as you
come to see your true magnificence.
Now back to the question of what we do about our goals, dreams,
and ambitions if we stop thinking. As I pondered on these questions,
an incredible amount of fear and anxiety began to surface because I
thought that I would have to give all of it up and become a monk in
the middle of the mountains.
I was definitely not ready to do that. As much as I wish I were that
enlightened and detached from my life, I genuinely enjoyed being in
the world, experiencing the fullness of life with other people, even if a
large portion of my life was filled with suffering.
Here's what I've discovered about what to do with our goals and
dreams with this new understanding. As we've mentioned in previous
chapters, there's a difference between thoughts versus thinking. The
source of thoughts and the source of thinking are different, and the
source is what will dictate whether it causes suffering or not.
Similarly, where our goals and dreams come from will determine
whether we feel great about pursuing them or not. Like everything in
this world, there is nothing inherently good or bad, only our thinking
makes it so. Goals, dreams, and ambitions are not good or bad, so
it's not really an either-or situation, but more about where those
goals are coming from.
There are two sources of goals: goals created out of
inspiration and goals created out of desperation.
When goals are created out of desperation, we feel a large sense
of scarcity and urgency. It feels heavy, like a burden, we may even
feel daunted by the colossal task we've just committed ourselves to,
imposter syndrome and self-doubt begin to manifest, and we always
feel like we never have enough time for anything. We go about our
life frantically, desperately searching for answers and ways that we
can accomplish our goal faster, always looking externally, never
feeling enough or that we can ever get enough. Worst of all, if we
happen to accomplish our goal, within a few hours or days
afterwards, all of those same feelings of lack begin to resurface. We
begin not feeling content with what we have done, unable to savor
our accomplishments and because what we did never feels like it‚Äôs
enough, we feel that same way about ourselves. Not knowing what
else to do, we look around for guidance externally to see what others
are doing and see they're continuing to do the same thing. Thus, we
go ahead and proceed to set another goal out of desperation in an
attempt to escape all of the negative feelings gnawing away at our
soul. When we dig a little deeper into these types of goals we set,
they are all typically ‚Äúmeans goals‚Äù and not ‚Äúend goals‚Äù. In other
words, the goals we set in this state of desperation are all a means
to an end. There's always a reason we want to accomplish the goal
and it's always for something else. For example, we want to create a
multi-million-dollar business because we want financial freedom, or
we want to quit our job so that we can escape the stress and anxiety
that comes from it. We feel like we HAVE to do these things instead
of WANT to. Goals created from desperation are typically "realistic"
and created from analyzing our past and what we think to be
"plausible" in the moment. It feels very confining and limiting.
Although these types of goals and dreams may excite us in the
moment, as soon as we begin to try to create it, we feel a lack, and
we are desperate to bring the dream to life. Paradoxically, if we do
end up achieving a goal created out of desperation, we end up
feeling even more empty than we did before it. The next "logical"
thing we tend to do is to set an even bigger goal out of even greater
desperation to hopefully make us feel whole inside.
This is how most of us set our goals and how we live our lives. I'm
also not saying this to criticize or judge at all, but to reveal the reality
of it. The only reason why I was able to describe it in painful and
excruciating detail was because that was my life.
Here's the good news: it's not your fault that you set goals that
way if you are and there's a way out. It's through creating goals and
dreams out of inspiration instead of desperation.
When we create goals out of inspiration versus desperation, it is a
completely different story. In this state, we are creating because we
feel deeply moved, inspired, and expansive. It feels like a calling
rather than an obligation. It is like there's a powerful force of life
coming from within us, wanting to be expressed through us to be
made manifested into the physical world. This is why painters paint,
why dancers dance, why writers write and why singers sing, even if
they never get paid or make a living from it. We feel pulled by a force
to create something. We gravitate towards it. We feel compelled to
do it. When we feel like this, we are creating from a place of
abundance instead of lack.
Most surprising of all is that in this state, we are creating not for
any reason at all, other than because we simply want to. We don't
create because we feel like we HAVE to. We create because we
simply want to and there's no other reason. We aren't creating these
goals so that we can do something else or use it as a means to get
something else we want. This creating comes from a place of
wholeness and abundance. It's an overflowing of love and joy for life.
This is the reason why most of us want or have kids. It's not so that
we can milk our kids for their money once they're old enough to work
and hopefully use them as a retirement plan. We want to have kids
because we want to share the abundance of what we have with
them, and it comes from a place of sharing what we have lots of
versus trying to get something out of them.
This feeling of deep inspiration is incredibly difficult to describe
because it does not come from this world. It really doesn't come from
us, but through us from something greater than us. I like to call this
feeling divine inspiration because the ideas and vision we have of
what we want to create seem to be far bigger than we could have
possibly imagined or come up with ourselves. Since divine
inspiration doesn't come from us but from something greater, it
doesn't analyze or rely on past data or what you or anyone in the
world has already accomplished. Divine inspiration is what happens
when groundbreaking creations and inventions are created that
seemed to be impossible not too long ago. It knows no boundaries,
limits, or constraints. It is an incredibly expansive force that
energizes and lifts us, making us feel like we're "high" on life. In this
state, we feel whole, complete, filled with unconditional love, joy, and
peace. We don't analyze, compare, criticize, judge, or rationalize
anything, but instead we truly live, love, share, give, create, grow,
and nourish. It really is one of the greatest feelings we can
experience, and it is truly a gift that we can experience the divine as
humans (and it's because we're from the same source).
Everyone has experienced this deep feeling and desire to create
something marvelous in the world that's out of pure inspiration and
not desperation. Before moving on to the next paragraph, I
encourage you to test this theory. Pause here and spend a few
minutes thinking about times in your life where you felt an
overwhelming feeling and desire to create something magnificent
because you felt deeply inspired and called to. It doesn't matter if
you actually created it or not, but just think of a time where you felt
that feeling to create out of inspiration.
Isn't that just one of the most amazing feelings in the entire world?
Most of us feel this divine inspiration, but then suppress it as soon as
we begin thinking about doing it. We begin to think ourselves into
doubt, rationalize why we can't do it, tell ourselves that it is
unrealistic, how we should focus on more important things, and that
we're not good enough to do it. As soon as we begin to think about
the thought of us wanting to create, it completely shuts off the source
of that inspiration and we go back to living life as usual. When we cut
off that source, we also cut off the feelings of abundance,
exuberance, ecstasy, joy, pure unconditional love, and go back to the
feelings of doubt, anxiety, frustration, sadness, and feel confined,
stuck, and frustrated with our lives.
We can only ever follow one calling at a time, either inspiration or
desperation in the present moment. The two cannot coexist at the
same time, but we can fluctuate between the two depending on how
much thinking is going on.
When we stop thinking, we don't stop having goals and dreams,
we actually fall back into our true nature and begin to create goals
and dreams out of inspiration versus desperation. We begin to allow
thoughts from the Universe to come into our mind that lead us to
divine inspiration to create something that has never been created
before in the world. When we follow divine inspiration, we feel alive,
whole, joy, love, peace, and fulfillment.
So how can we tell when a goal or dream is created out of
inspiration or desperation?
A simple way to know if a goal or dream is created out of
inspiration is to remember the distinction between thoughts and
thinking. Goals and dreams that come in the form of thought are
created out of inspiration. Goals and dreams that come from thinking
are created out of desperation.
Typically, when we think, we'll analyze, judge, criticize, rationalize,
and use our past to try to create our new goals, but this form of
creating goals feels extremely restricting and limiting. We don't
typically feel good when creating these types of goals and when
we're pursuing them, we do not feel great either, since it's all out of
desperation.
Another way to identify the two is to sense how you feel
energetically. Goals and dreams created out of desperation will feel
very heavy, draining, confining, and empty. We tend to feel a lot of
scarcity, fear, and stress, like we HAVE to do it or that we are
obligated to. With these types of goals, it seems like if we do not
accomplish it, that there will be dire consequences, hence the high
pressure and stakes (I'm sure you can see now how this can create
the feeling of desperation). Moreover, we feel like we're trying to
accomplish these goals to escape our current situation and get out of
something. Our goals created in this state are typically means goals,
meaning that we want to achieve these goals so that we can do
something else afterwards, such as having the goal to quit our job.
Most likely you'll have this goal because you want to go do
something you actually enjoy, but you can see how the goal of
quitting your job is just a means goal for you to go do something
else. Or having a goal of making $1 million is typically set because
you want to have financial freedom and go travel the world. These
goals are always a means to an end and not the end itself. There's
always a reason that we want to accomplish these goals and it
makes us feel very empty inside.
I want to emphasize that none of these goals are inherently bad or
that we shouldn't have goals of wanting to make money or quitting
our jobs. If those goals are created from inspiration, that is
completely different. It just depends on the source of the goals and
not necessarily the goal itself. This is an important distinction to
make, otherwise you'll spend most of your time debating and
stressing yourself out over if this is the right goal for you or not.
There is no right or wrong goal, only goals created from inspiration or
desperation. It just depends on how you want to feel inside and
when you're aware of these two types of goals and how they
manifest, then you'll be able to feel blissful as you go about creating
amazing things in your life.
On the other hand, goals and dreams created out of inspiration
(which comes from thought) feel very light, energizing, uplifting, and
expansive. We tend to feel excited, joyful, and most importantly,
inspired. We don't feel like we HAVE to create it, but that we WANT
to. Instead of feeling like you NEED to do this, you feel inspired to.
There is virtually no pressure because we're not trying to get out of
something or escape our current situation by accomplishing this
goal. There is no scarcity or urgency because we don't feel like we're
creating from a place of lack, but instead from a place of abundance
and we just want to share it with the world. Since it's coming from
inspiration, we are not doing it to get something out of it so that we
can do something else. It's not a means goal, but simply an end in
and of itself. There is no "reason" we need to create it. We are not
creating so that we can feel whole, but we are creating because we
feel whole and want to give from that place, not expecting anything
from it.
I'm sure you can see the stark difference between the two now
and that you can tell which type your goals currently fall under. If
most of your goals fall under the category of desperation, don't worry
because most people have goals created from desperation, including
myself before I knew a better way.
So how do we create goals and dreams out of inspiration versus
desperation?
Creating goals and dreams from divine inspiration isn't something
you have to try to do. We naturally have thoughts of infinite
inspiration all the time. If you look at children, they naturally have the
wildest dreams and imaginations of what they want to do. It almost
doesn't even register in their minds that they can't do something
most of the time. The only difference between us and children is that
we have learned to shut down all these thoughts of inspiration which
contain our dreams, hopes, and goals that we truly want to see
manifested in the world. Our minds are filled more with reasons of
why we can't than thoughts of what we want to create.
We innately have an infinite flow of inspiration that comes through
us, but we block that flow as soon as we begin thinking about the
thoughts we have, which causes self-doubt, self-sabotage, and
anxiety. Think of the flow of inspiration to create like a river. The river
always flows until man puts something there to block it, like a dam.
Then when the dam is there, we ask why there are so many fish
dying, animals disappearing, and forests dwindling, when all we
need to do was return the river back to its natural state and
everything will be working perfectly fine, the way nature intended it
to.
